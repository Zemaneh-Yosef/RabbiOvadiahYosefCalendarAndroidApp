Although Shabbat is another day that should be over after בין השמשות, there are factors to be stringent for. For one, it is a Biblical time, meaning we require at minimum to use the most extended Ben Hashemashot opinion while still keeping within the Geonic framework (meaning we use the 20 minute Nightfall as reference instead of the 13.5 minute one; the extra two minutes in 20 is meant to accommodate רב יוסי's opinion on בין השמשות, on top of the Rambam's Nightfall opinion of 18 minutes). Secondly, the Shulḥan Arukh rules one can only take out Shabbat once all elements of doubt were clarified. We pair this warning with another concept called "תוספת שבת" (discussed in שו"ע או"ח רצ"ג:א), to extend the length of Shabbat beyond the legal end-time to accommodate other opinions. There are a few of them at play, including:

- Determining these times **astronomically**, independent of the law-based seasonal-minute calculation. Solving this would mean giving a generic time that could encompass everything or being very precise that would make the value vary weekly (through the use of degrees below the horizon)
- An accommodation for the מג'רב, adding an extra 7 minutes to the final count. This is the position represented in the בא"ח, (שנה ראשון) ויקהל ד', אור לציון א' יו"ד סימן י'. This is taken practically by Rav Yitzḥak Yosef (עין יצחק חלק ג עמוד ת"ב)
- Following in the footsteps of the extremely pious individuals throughout Sepharadic history (ראה באור לציון ד' פרק כ' הערה ב) that waited until the time of Nightfall according to _Rabbenu Tam_ (as codified in Pesahim Bavli 94a) prior to doing melakha. This would make the time length of **72 seasonal minutes** long (with a limit outside Eretz Yisrael to 72 fixed minutes when the seasonal time is longer than this, as quoted in ילקוט יוסף (מהדורה חדשה) סימן רצ"ג עמוד תשכד; הלכה ברורה, הקדמת לסימן רס"א הלכה י"ט; יודעי בינה ז':ו)

Thereby, although Maran Ovadya zt"l recommended the time for Rabbenu Tam for those who could have - יביע עומר ב' סימן כ"א, he concluded a minimum time in Israel of 30 fixed minutes every week. To extend this beyond the borders of Eretz Yisrael (Yalkut Yosef - new edition, siman 261 page 755) we have measured where the sun would be below the horizon 30 minutes below the horizon on the equinox day in Eretz Yisrael, and apply that "degree count" (7.165º) everywhere. Although there is precedent to use methods that would result in even shorter times (ילקוט טהרה מכתב עז), we have used this stricter measurement to ensure one would not be more lenient than the printed Ohr Hachaim calendar when applied to Eretz Yisrael.

A minimum is enforced in cases where the astronomical time would result in a time earlier than the legal standards within the opinions of Geonic nightfall (20 seasonal minutes, 20 fixed minutes).
