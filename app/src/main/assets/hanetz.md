Sunrise ("Hanetz") is the ideal beginning of the new Halachic day, where one can now perform any day-dependent Mitzvot (Shofar, Lulav, Megillah) in an optimal fashion. The time period itself is also the proper time to be saying the Tefilah of Shacharit, based on the verse (Tehilim 72:5) "יִֽירָא֥וּךָ עִם־שָׁ֣מֶשׁ"; "They will fear you with the sun". Many take extra precision to ensure they start by the sunrise minute (as adviced by R Yitzḥak Yosef, Yalkut Yosef 5781 edition, pg. 440), although Maran zt"l himself wasn't as time-precise (see Orḥot Maran I 7:5).

Internally, we determine this time (elevation-included, for those in Eretz Yisrael) as the moment the sun's sphere's uppermost edge peeks above the eastern horizon (Yalkut Yosef - new edition, siman 89 page 460), for the exact latitude & longitude as the user. Nevertheless, when displaying this time, we try to match a "Visible Sunrise" as closely as possible (Eshel Avraham Botchach, Oraḥ Ḥayim 89; Yalkut Yosef, new edition, siman 89 page 51), which is "when the sun starts shining on the hilltops" (תלמדי רבינו יונה על ברכות ד: בדפי הריף). As such, we provide users with a way to use these times generated from the ChaiTables website (provided by Rabbi Chaim Keller), with a fallback of displaying the standard sunrise time (without elevation) when these generated times are not downloaded.
