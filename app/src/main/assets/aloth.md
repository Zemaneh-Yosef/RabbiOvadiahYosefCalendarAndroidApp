Dawn begins the halachic day, signified by the visibility of the sun's rays in the illuminated eastern sky. (Rosh, Berakhoth 4:1; Rambam Pirush Mishnayoth Yoma 3:1; Shulḥan Arukh O.Ḥ. 89:1). In Hebrew, this time is either called עלות השחר (as used in Genesis 32:25; Variant of וכמו השחר עלה is used in Genesis 19:15) or עמוד השחר (as used in משנה ברכות א:א). It's the moment that transitions from the night's commandments (examples: תיקון רחל, קריאת שמע של ערבית & תפילת ערבית) to the day's commandments (like not eating before prayer; S"A O"Ḥ 89:5), even if not a full-proof perfect one. This is because there are cases where the night's commandments (קריאת שמע בלי ברכת השכיבנו) could still be done into the day, and practically, one should still not perform positive commandments (such as prayer) until sunrise (unless there is a pressing circumstance. Also, one who erroneously did any commandment before sunrise is exempt post-facto).

These Halachic times are determined not through what our eyes see (whether the sky correlates to the astronomical description of Dawn above), but rather through measurements. On the average day (where there are 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night), one could measure the length of the day from sunrise to sunset, break them up into smaller units called "mil" - each spanning 18 minutes (ש"ע או"ח תנט:ב), and use 4 of those mil (as held by R' Yehuda, פסחים בבלי צד) to get to a Dawn time that takes place 72 minutes before sunrise.

The codification of this law from our authorities views the context of the Talmud (Israel on the spring equinox - Erev Pesaḥ) as a means to create an astronomical parallel of where the sun is below the horizon (16.04 degrees) to the passage of time; however, when the parameters change (such as the different days of the calendar or different locations than Israel), we maintain the time length of twilight would also accommodate.

Recreating the context of the Gemara is as easy as applying the sun's position ("degree") below the horizon on the equinox day at those minutes to the respective location. [Halacha Berurah (intro to siman 261 halacha 13), based on Minḥath Kohen (2 4), Pri Ḥadash (Kuntres DeBey Shimshey 8) & Bet David (104). Although R David writes one should only be stringent and increase, the logic of using it for leniencies by regular seasonal minutes also apply by these adjusted-seasonal minutes] One could then measure the time that this astronomical event takes place until sunrise to get the length of twilight fitting for that location. To fit it with the normative Sepharadic custom of using minutes based on how long the sun is above the horizon, this twilight period is then lengthened/shortened accordingly. (see further: מנחת כהן (מבוא השמש מאמר ב פרק ג) על שו"ת פאר הדור 44. זה פסק של מרן עובדיה, והביא ראיה מבא"ח (שנה ראשונה - וארא ה, ויקהל ד, צב ח; שנה שניה - נח ז; רב פעלים ב:ב), וכן הסכים הילקוט יוסף (נ"ח:ג))

The calendar times generated using our formula may result in either a leniency or a stringency, dependent on the scenario & the other time used in the comparison. Due to the nature of how reliant we are on our time, *any* other formula that would generate more comfortable/lenient times may **not** be used to supersede our "stringencies", considering they use premises not adopted by our authorities.
