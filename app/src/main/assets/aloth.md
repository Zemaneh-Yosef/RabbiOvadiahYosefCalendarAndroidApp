Dawn is the time that rays of sun can be seen in the lit up Eastern part of the sky (Rosh, Brachot 4:1; Rambam Pirush Mishnayot Yoma 3:1; Shulchan Aruch O.C. 89:1). Halachically, it is the time that we transition from night into day.

- The Night-Time Shema (when omitted due to negligence), Tikkun Hatzot, and the evening prayer are no longer recitable past this time.
- The obligation to start fulfilling daytime commandments start from this time. As such, since there is an explicit prohibition to eat before prayer, one may not eat anymore.
   - However, this is not an ideal time to fulfil commandments; they should only be fulfilled at this point when one has a pressing need. Otherwise, it should be delayed until after sunrise (הנץ החמה). Nevertheless, if one erroneously did it at this point, they are still exempt.
   - Wearing Tallit & Tefilin requires Misheyakir, as they have an explicit start time within Brachot Bavli.

The Talmud Bavli in Pesachim (92b-94a) measures the time between sunset and calculative nightfall, which is then matched to the time interval from dawn to sunrise. We hold by Rabbi Yehuda, who measured the time at 4 mil. Since a singular mil is 18 minutes (Rambam Pirush Mishnayot Brachot 1:1 & Shulchan Aruch O.C. 459:1), one can multiply the length of a mil by the amount of mil needed to find that Alot is 72 seasonal minutes before sunrise.
- This is the Halichot Olam’s interpretation of “Rambam Pe’er HaDor 44”, recorded in volume 1, pages 106 and 248-250.
- The definition of *calculative* nightfall (72 seasonal minutes) is not to be confused with what we halachically maintain nightfall is (13.5 seasonal minutes).

The Amudeh Hora’ah and Ohr Hachaim calendars both calculate seasonal hours and minutes by dividing the time interval between sunset and sunrise by 12, then dividing the seasonal hour by 60. However, the Amudeh Hora’ah calendar argues (based on several authoritative sources of early Acharonim) that taking into consideration only the length of day without also accounting for the discrepancy of latitude is erroneous. Instead, each locale must determine its own number of seasonal minutes based on its relation to Israel on the equinox days. This can be done by applying the same level of darkness found in Israel (16.04 degrees) to any location, then determining its own Alot minutes based on assessing that darkness vis a vis sunrise and counting this duration of time.

Fun fact: Within the Torah, this time is typically referred to under a variant of Alot Hashachar. While this exact term is used in fight between Eisav's Angel and Yaakov (Genesis 32:25), the variant of וכמו השחר עלה is used in Genesis 19:15. However, the language used by the Mishnah (Brachot 1:1) is Amud Hashachar (עמוד השחר).
