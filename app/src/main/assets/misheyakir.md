Misheyakir (literally "when you recognize") is the time where there is enough light in the sky for one to distinguish between the colors of white & "Techelet" (blue - משנה תורה ב:א & מגיד משרים פרשת קרח). Mitzvot that depend on recognition can be done now (Berakhot 9b), such as:

- Wearing ציצית (Braitah in Menachot 43b quoting the verse in Bamidbar 15:39 - וראיתם אותו)
- Wearing תפילין (Rabbenu Yona quoting the verse in Devarim 28:10 - וְרָאוּ֙ כׇּל־עַמֵּ֣י הָאָ֔רֶץ כִּ֛י שֵׁ֥ם יְהֹוָ֖ה נִקְרָ֣א עָלֶ֑יךָ)
- Reciting Shema (MG"A on Orach Hayim 58:6 in the name of the Ramban - The way to fulfil ובקומך is when people get up, and most people get up when they can see someone who they are somewhat familiar with 4 אמות away).

Although each of these actions are based on different forms of recognition, the Bet Yosef says that they are really all in the same time.

Although earlier authorities did not assign any type of measurement to this time (leaving it to be determined on a practical level), later authorities used measurements relative to the time of Dawn. Without restating how to calculate Dawn, Misheyakir according to the letter of the law happens after **1&frasl;12<sup>th</sup>'s** of the time passed from Dawn until sunrise ("six zemaniyot/seasonal minutes"). However, that time is the letter-of-the-law, for those who need to go to work or leave early in the morning to travel; people should ideally wait until **1&frasl;6<sup>th</sup>'s** of the time passed instead ("twelve zemaniyot/seasonal minutes"). Which is why the 66-minute time is hidden by default.

This time is subject to many The time allocated to each is consistently different The default calculation  are different times The Gemara (ברכות ט) explains that when a person can distinguish between the blue (techelet) and white strings of their tzitzit, that is the earliest time a person can put on their talit and tefilin for Shacharit.

    <p>
    This is also the earliest time one can say Shema L'chatchila
    (optimally).
    </p>
    <p>
    This time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to
    the GR\"A) after Alot HaShachar (Dawn).
    </p>
    <p>
    Note: This time is only for people who need to go to work or leave
    early in the morning to travel. However, normally a person should
    put on his talit/tefilin 60 regular minutes (and in the winter 50
    regular minutes) before sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
    In Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out
    how many minutes are between sunrise and 72 minutes as degrees
    (16.1) before sunrise on an equal day with sunrise and sunset set
    around 12 hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them
    zmaniyot according to the GR\"A, and we subtract 5/6 of that time
    from sunrise to get the time for Misheyakir. This is according to
    the Halacha Berurah, and this should only be done outside of Israel
    in more northern or southern areas. The Halacha Berurah writes to do
    this because it is more according to the nature of the world.
    However, it does not seem like Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L or the
    Yalkut Yosef agrees with this opinion. Elevation is not included in
    Luach Amudei Horaah mode. -->
