        Ideally, this app needs location permissions in order to accurately calculate the zmanim.
        Therefore, it is better to allow the app to see your location. We do not use your location
        for any other purpose than to calculate the zmanim.\n\nHowever, if you still do not want to give location
        permissions, you can choose to search for your address or a zipcode and the app will find your location based on your approximate area.
        (Using a zip code is not recommended if you want accurate Zemanim. It is better to put in your address.)

    <string name="long_explanation">
        Rabbi Asher Darshan (who was on the team for the Ohr HaChaim calendar in Israel) told me that Rabbi Ovadia Yosef ZT\"L held that the actual sunrise/sunset that should be used for calculating zmanim is when sunrise/sunset is seen at the highest point in the city. However, Rabbi David Yosef Shlita writes that many have told him that Rabbi Ovadiah ZT\"L held to use Mishor (Sea Level) sunrise/sunset. Rabbi Leeor Dahan says that it makes sense to use elevation in cities that have hills, and to not use it when the city, E.G. New York, is close to sea level. You can use the buttons below to choose the appropriate settings that you want. (See Halacha Berura vol. 14, in Otzrot Yosef (Kuntrus Ki Ba Hashemesh), Siman 6, Perek 21 for an in depth discussion)

    <string name="settings">Settings</string>

    <string name="helper_text">Welcome to the Rabbi Ovadia Yosef Calendar app (also known as Zemaneh Yosef), this app was made to help you find out the most accurate Zemanim of the day according to Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L for your own city! Please follow the "Get Started" process of the app to set it up and here are some things to keep in mind:

 \n\n1.) You should ideally choose your city and download the visible sunrise tables through the simple setup. This table contains the most accurate times for VISIBLE sunrise, and this is the algorithm that the Ohr HaChaim calendar uses in Israel as the Yalkut Yosef writes (Yalkut Yosef Tefila 1, page 48). However, these tables only go on for 2 years into the future and will need to be updated bi-yearly. If you do not want to use these tables, you can choose to skip the setup, and the app will instead use the regular NOAA algorithm for sunrise (without elevation included as it is similar enough).

 \n\n2.) There are a few different minhagim to choose from in the settings part of the app. Make sure to choose the correct ones for your city/kehila. For example, the default candle lighting time is set to 20 minutes before sunset, and the default end time for shabbat is set to 40 minutes after sunset. Please change these settings to your own customs if desired.

 \n\n3.) Lastly, the zmanim can be included with seconds, DO NOT RELY ON THESE SECONDS. The only zman that can be relied on to the second is the visible sunrise time based on chaitables.com. Otherwise, these zmanim are NOT accurate to the second! You should always round up or down a minute or two just in case.

 \n\nIn addition to all of this, there are features in place that will automatically tell you to update the elevation data or the visible sunrise tables. If you leave the city that you currently setup the app for, the app will prompt you to run the setup again. The reason for this feature is because elevation will change based on the city that you are located in and you will have to update it every time you change cities, however, this feature will only turn on if you use elevation. If you have any issues or concerns, send an email to: ElyahuJacobi@gmail.com

    <string name="intro">This "Visual Sunrise" setup will replace our listed sunrise times with their equivalent from the ChaiTables.com website &amp; "Bechorei Yosef" calendar in Israel. These times are more accurate for those who pray Shaḥarit by sunrise, and they\'re in use by the Ohr HaChaim calendar in Israel.\n\nAll you need to provide is your country and metro area (with it sometimes asking for a state too). Our table-downloader will first find the smallest radius of your town, and then download the tables for the next two years. For future years, the table will reuse information saved from this setup to load your data as seamlessly as possible.\n\nIf you want to specify more information (such as a custom radius size), you should instead use our "Advanced Setup" - this will allow you to specify your own ChaiTables link to scrape from. You could navigate the website in our app if you don\'t have a ChaiTables link.\n\nIt will then ask you if you want to setup elevation for the city the app is set to. Know that the elevation data changes for each and every city and you will need to set the elevation data of your city every time you change cities.</string>

    <string name="alot_dialog">In Tanach this time is called Alot HaShachar (בראשית לב:כה), whereas in the gemara it is called Amud HaShachar.\n\nThis is the time when the day begins according to halacha. Most mitzvot (commandments), Arvit for example, that take place at night are not allowed to be done after this time.\nAfter this time, mitzvot that must be done in the daytime are allowed to be done B\'dieved (after the fact) or B\'shaat hadachak (in a time of need). However, one should ideally wait until sunrise to do them L\'chatchila (optimally).\n\nThis time is calculated as 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to the GR\"A) before sunrise. Both sunrise and sunset have elevation included.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out how many minutes are between sunrise and 72 minutes as degrees (16.04) before sunrise on a equal day with sunrise and sunset set around 12 hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them zmaniyot according to the GR\"A and we subtract that time from sunrise to get the time for Alot Hashachar. This is according to the Halacha Berurah and this should only be done outside of Israel in more northern or southern areas.</string>
    <string name="misheyakir_dialog">Misheyakir (literally \"when you recognize\") is the time when a person can distinguish between blue and white. The gemara (ברכות ט) explains that when a person can distinguish between the blue (techelet) and white strings of their tzitzit, that is the earliest time a person can put on their talit and tefilin for shacharit.\n\nThis is also the earliest time one can say Shema L\'chatchila (optimally).\n\nThis time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to the GR\"A) after Alot HaShachar (Dawn).\n\nNote: This time is only for people who need to go to work or leave early in the morning to travel, however, normally a person should put on his talit/tefilin 60 regular minutes (and in the winter 50 regular minutes) before sunrise.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out how many minutes are between sunrise and 72 minutes as degrees (16.04) before sunrise on a equal day with sunrise and sunset set around 12 hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them zmaniyot according to the GR\"A and we subtract 5/6 of that time from sunrise to get the time for Misheyakir. This is according to the Halacha Berurah and this should only be done outside of Israel in more northern or southern areas. The Halacha Berurah writes to do this because it is more according to the nature of the world, however, it does not seem like Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L or the Yalkut Yosef agrees with this opinion. Elevation is not included in Luach Amudei Horaah mode.</string>
    <string name="sunrise_dialog">This is the earliest time when all mitzvot (commandments) that are to be done during the daytime are allowed to be performed L\'chatchila (optimally). Halachic sunrise is defined as the moment when the top edge of the sun appears on the horizon while rising. This halachic sunrise is called mishor (sea level) sunrise and it is what many jews rely on when praying for Netz.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the Shulchan Aruch writes in Orach Chayim 89:1, \"The mitzvah of shacharit starts at Netz, like it says in the pasuk/verse, \'יראוך עם שמש\'\". Based on this, the poskim write that a person should wait until the sun is VISIBLE to say shacharit. In Israel, the Ohr HaChaim calendar uses a table of sunrise times from the luach/calendar \'לוח ביכורי יוסף\' (Luach Bechoray Yosef) each year. These times were made by Chaim Keller, creator of the ChaiTables website. Ideally, you should download these VISIBLE sunrise times from his website with the capability of this app by pressing the button below. However, if you did not download the times, you will see \'Mishor\' or \'Sea Level\' sunrise instead.</string>
    <string name="achilat_chametz_dialog">This is the latest time a person can eat Chametz before Pesach begins.\n\nThis is calculated as 4 zmaniyot/seasonal hours, according to the Magen Avraham, after Alot HaShachar (Dawn) (elevation affects this time). Since Chametz is a mitzvah from the torah, we are stringent and we use the Magen Avraham\'s time to calculate the last time a person can eat chametz since it results in an earlier time.\n\nOutside of Israel, this time is calculated the same way as above except using the adjusted Alot/Tzet from the Amudeh Horaah calendar that is based on the distance from the equator.\n\nIf Erev Pesach falls out on Shabbat, this zman represents the latest time a person can have the day meal with chametz.</string>
    <string name="biur_chametz_dialog">This is the latest time a person can own Chametz before Pesach begins. You should get rid of all Chametz in your possession by this time.\n\nThis is calculated as 5 zmaniyot/seasonal hours, according to the MG\"A, after Alot HaShachar (Dawn) (elevation affects this time).\n\nOutside of Israel, this time is calculated the same way as above except using the adjusted Alot/Tzet from the Amudeh Horaah calendar that is based on the distance from the equator.\n\nIf Erev Pesach falls out on Shabbat, even though you can not burn chametz, this time represents the latest time a person can own Chametz on Shabbat. You would still need to get rid of it/destroy it before this time.</string>
    <string name="shmaMGAdialog">This is the latest time a person can fulfill his obligation to say Shma everyday according to the Magen Avraham.\n\nThe Magen Avraham/Terumat HeDeshen calculate this time as 3 zmaniyot/seasonal hours after Alot HaShachar (Dawn). They calculate a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between Alot HaShachar (Dawn) and Tzeit Hachocavim (Nightfall) of Rabbeinu Tam and divide it into 12 equal parts.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as above except using the skewed Alot/Tzait of the Amudei Horaah calendar, and no elevation is included.</string>
    <string name="shmaGRAdialog">This is the latest time a person can fulfill his obligation to say Shma everyday according to the GR\"A (HaGaon Rabbeinu Eliyahu)\n\nThe GR\"A calculates this time as 3 zmaniyot/seasonal hours after sunrise (elevation affects this time). The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation affects this time) and divides it into 12 equal parts.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as above except no elevation is included.</string>
    <string name="brachotSHMAdialog">This is the latest time a person can say the Brachot Shma according to the GR\"A. However, a person can still say Pisukei D\'Zimra and Amidah until Chatzot.\n\nThe GR\"A calculates this time as 4 zmaniyot/seasonal hours (based on sunrise to sunset) after sunrise (elevation affects this time).</string>
    <string name="chatzot_dialog">This is the middle of the halachic day, when the sun is exactly in the middle of the sky relative to the length of the day. It should be noted, that the sun can only be directly above every person, such that they don\'t even have shadows, in the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Everywhere else, the sun will be at an angle even in the middle of the day.\n\nAfter this time, you can no longer say the Amidah prayer of Shacharit, and you should preferably say Musaf before this time.\n\nThis time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal hours after sunrise. The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset and divides it into 12 equal parts.</string>
    <string name="mincha_gedola_dialog">Mincha Gedolah, literally \"Greater Mincha\", is the earliest time a person can say Mincha. It is also the preferred time a person should say Mincha according to some poskim.\n\nIt is called Mincha Gedolah because there is a lot of time left until sunset.\n\nA person should ideally start saying Korbanot AFTER this time.\n\nThis time is calculated as 30 regular minutes after Chatzot (Mid-day). However, if the zmaniyot/seasonal minutes are longer, we use those minutes instead to be stringent. The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation affects this time) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute.</string>
    <string name="mincha_ketana_dialog">Mincha Ketana, literally \"Lesser Mincha\", is the most preferred time a person can say Mincha according to some poskim (Rambam, Shulchan Aruch).\n\nIt is called Mincha Ketana because there is less time left until sunset.\n\nThis time is calculated as 9 and a half zmaniyot/seasonal hours after sunrise. The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation affects this time) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute.</string>
    <string name="plag_dialog">Plag HaMincha, literally \"Half of Mincha\", is the midpoint between Mincha Ketana and sunset. Since Mincha Ketana is 2 and a half hours before sunset, Plag is half of that at an hour and 15 minutes before sunset.\n\nYou can start saying arvit/maariv by this time according to Rabbi Yehudah in (ברכות כ\'ו ע\'א).\n\nA person should not accept shabbat before this time as well.\n\nThe Halacha Berurah says to calculate this time by subtracting an hour and 15 zmaniyot minutes from sunset, however, the Yalkut Yosef says to calculate it as 1 hour and 15 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes before tzeit (13.5 zmaniyot minutes). \n\nOutside of Israel, tzet hakokhavim is deviated to accommodate the change in location.\n\nThe GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation affects this time) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute.</string>
    <string name="candle_lighting_dialog">This is the ideal time for a person to light the candles before shabbat/chag starts. However, bediavad, a person can light the candles as late as five minutes before sunset if they were not able to light it at the appropriate time.\n\nIf it is Shabbat going into a Yom Tov that has candle lighting, the candles are lit after Tzeit/Nightfall. However, if the next day is Shabbat, the candles are lit at their usual time before sunset.\n\nYou have this time set to be calculated as %s regular minutes before sunset (elevation affects this time).\n\nThe Ohr HaChaim calendar always shows the candle lighting times for 20 and 40 minutes before sunset.</string>
    <string name="sunset_dialog">This is the time of the day that the day starts to transition into the next day according to halacha.\n\nHalachic sunset is defined as the moment when the top edge of the sun disappears on the horizon while setting (elevation affects this time).\n\nImmediately after the sun sets, Bein Hashmashot/twilight starts according to the Geonim, however, according to Rabbenu Tam the sun continues to set for another 58.5 minutes and only after that Bein Hashmashot starts for another 13.5 minutes.\n\nIt should be noted that even though Rabbi Ovadia says that you can say mincha until nightfall, many poskim, like the Mishna Berura, say that a person should ideally say mincha BEFORE sunset and not before Tzeit/Nightfall.\n\nMost mitzvot that are to be done during the day should ideally be done before this time.</string>
    <string name="tzait_dialog">Tzeit/Nightfall is the time when the next halachic day starts after Bein Hashmashot/twilight finishes.\n\nThis is the latest time a person can say Mincha according Rav Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL. A person could start the amidah of mincha at any time that is at least before this time. (Yabia Omer 7 Siman 34)\n\nThis time is shown in gray on shabbat and yom tov (as advised by our rabbeim) in order to not let people think that shabbat/yom tov ends at this time.\n\nThis time is calculated as 13 and a half zmaniyot/seasonal minutes after sunset (elevation affects this time).\n\nThe GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation affects this time) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute.\n\nOutside of Israel, this time is calculated by finding out the amount of minutes between sunset and when the sun is 3.7 degrees below the horizon on the equinox (12 hours between sunrise and sunset), then we add that amount of zmaniyot minutes to sunset all year round to get the time of Tzeit/Nightfall. We use 3.7 degrees below the horizon because that is the time when it is 13.5 minutes after sunset in Israel.</string>
    <string name="tzait_lchumra_dialog">This time is calculated as 20 seasonal minutes after sunset (elevation affects this time) (Yalkut Yosef Siman 261:2).\n\nThis time is important for fast days and deciding when to do a brit milah. Otherwise, it should not be used for anything else like the latest time for mincha.\n\nThis time is shown in gray on shabbat and yom tov (as advised by our rabbeim) in order to not let people think that shabbat/yom tov ends at this time.\n\nOutside of Israel, this time is calculated by finding out the amount of minutes between sunset and 5.075 degrees below the horizon on the equinox (12 hours between sunrise and sunset), then we add that amount of zmaniyot minutes to sunset all year round to get the time of Tzeit/Nightfall L\'Chumra. We use 5.075 degrees below the horizon because that is the time when it is 20 minutes after sunset in Israel.</string>
    <string name="taanit_ends_dialog">This time is calculated as 20 seasonal minutes (outside of Israel, 20 seasonal minutes adjusted based on the distance from the equator) after sunset (elevation affects this time) (Yalkut Yosef Siman 261:2).\n\nIt is brought down in Halacha Berurah (vol. 14, in Otzrot Yosef [Kuntrus Ki Ba Hashemesh]) that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL was once traveling in New York on Tisha Beav and he said to his son, Rabbi David Yosef Shlita, that the fast ends at tzeit geonim (13.5 zmaniyot minutes after sunset). However, in his sefer Chazon Ovadiah (Arba Taaniyot Page 12), he writes that the fast ends around 20 minutes after sunset.\n\nIn the Ohr HaChaim calendar, they write that the fast ends at Tzait Hacochavim. Rabbi Benizri (author of the calendar) explains that it refers to either 13.5 or 20 minutes after sunset, and he said, \"The calendar just says that the fast ends at Tzait Hacochavim, a person can end the fast at 20 minutes after sunset if he wants to be stringent.\"\n\nWe have set the end time of the fast to be at the 20 minute time because the Chazon Ovadia quoted above is stringent for fasts, however, someone who wants to end the fast at the 13.5 minute time has the right to do so.</string>
    <string name="taanit_ends_lchumra_dialog">This is a more stringent time that the fast/taanit ends. This time is according to the opinion of Chacham Ben Zion Abba Shaul.\n\nThis time is calculated as 30 regular minutes after sunset (elevation affects this time).</string>
    <string name="tzait_shabbat_dialog">This is the time that Shabbat/Chag ends.\n\nNote that there are many customs on when shabbat ends, by default, it is set to 30 regular minutes after sunset (elevation affects this time) in Israel. Rabbi Meir Gavriel Elbaz Shlita has told me that anywhere outside of Israel, if you wait 40 regular minutes after sunset, that is for sure enough time to end shabbat.\n\nOutside of Israel, this time is calculated by using a degree of 7.165. We use this degree because Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L ruled that regarding Motzeh Shabbat the listed time should be set as 30 fixed minutes after sunset. This degree is interpreted as 30 minutes after sunset all year round in Israel. You can change this time in the settings to accommodate your communities minhag.</string>
    <string name="rt_dialog">This time is Tzeit/Nightfall according to Rabbenu Tam.\n\nTzeit/Nightfall is the time when the next halachic day starts after Bein Hashmashot/twilight finishes.\n\nAccording to Rabbeinu Tam, these 72 minutes are made up of 2 parts. The first part is 58 and a half minutes until the second sunset (see Pesachim 94a and Tosafot there). After the second sunset, there are an additional 13.5 minutes until Tzeit/Nightfall.\n\nRabbi Ovadia writes (Halichot Olam, Chelek 1, Page 250, Halacha 2 and Yalkut Yosef Siman 261:1) that it is proper to wait until the time of Rabbenu Tam has passed for biblical matters like Shabbat and Yom Kippur. Rabbi David Yosef (Halacha Berura Siman 293) includes Yom Tov into this stringency. However, it should be noted that second day Yamim Tovim are not biblical and therefore do not need this stringency.\n\nThis time is calculated as 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes after sunset (elevation affects this time). However, outside of Israel, this time is calculated by finding out the amount of minutes between sunset and when the sun is 16.04 degrees below the horizon on the equinox (when there is 12 hours between sunrise and sunset) and adding that amount of zmaniyot minutes to sunset all year round. In more northern places in the world, this adjustment will make the time for Rabbenu Tam extremely late, therefore, we limit the maximum time limit for Rabbenu Tam to 72 regular minutes. This is based on Yalkut Yosef Siman 293:6 and Halacha Berurah 15 Page 42.\n\nThe GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation affects this time) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute in order to calculate 72 minutes.</string>
    <string name="chatzot_layla_dialog">This is the middle of the halachic night, when the sun is exactly in the middle of it\'s solar transit of the celestial meridian after it sets. It should be noted, that the sun can only be directly underneath in the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Everywhere else, the sun will be at an angle even in the middle of the night.\n\nIt is ideal to have Melaveh Malka before this time.\n\nThis time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal hours (based on sunset of today and sunrise of the next day) after sunset.</string>
    <string name="ulchaparat_pesha_dialog">When Rosh Chodesh happens during a leap year, we add the words, \"וּלְכַפָּרַת פֶּשַׁע\" during Musaf. We only add these words from Tishri until the second month of Adar. However, for the rest of the year and during non leap years we do not say it. (Chazon Ovadiah Chanukah 306)</string>
    <string name="elevation_dialog">This number represents the amount of elevation that you are applying to your zmanim to see sunrise/sunset in your current city in meters. If the number is set to 0, then you are calculating the zmanim by mishor/sea level sunrise and sunset.\n\nThere is a debate as to what Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL held about using elevation for zmanim. (See Halacha Berura vol. 14, in Otzrot Yosef (Kuntrus Ki Ba Hashemesh), Siman 6, Perek 21 for an in depth discussion) The Ohr HaChaim calendar uses elevation for their zmanim, however, Rabbi David Yosef Shlita holds that the elevation is not used for zmanim. Rabbi Leeor Dahan Shlita has told me that it makes sense to use elevation in areas that are located on top of mountains. However, in areas that are by the sea, for example New York, you would not use elevation.</string>
    <string name="tekufa_dialog">This is the time that the tekufa (season) changes.\n\nThere are 4 tekufas every year: Tishri (autumn), Tevet (winter), Nissan (spring), and Tammuz (summer). Each Tekufa happens 91.3125 (365.25 / 4) days after the previous Tekufa.\n\nThe Achronim write that a person should not drink water when the seasons change. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL writes (in Halichot Olam, Chelek 7, Page 183, Halacha 8) that a person should not drink water from a half hour before this time till a half hour after this time unless there is a slim piece of iron in the water.\n\nNOTE: This only applies to water, not to other drinks.\n\nBoth the Ohr HaChaim and the Amudei Horaah calendars use the above method to get the time for the tekufa. However, the Amudei Horaah calendar differs from the Ohr HaChaim calendar, by using the local midday time of Israel. Which causes a 21 minute difference. Therefore, the Amudei Horaah calendar time for the tekufa will always be 21 minutes before the Ohr HaChaim\'s time.\n\nIn practice, it is recommended to keep both times if possible as it is only adding an additional 21 minutes.</string>
    <string name="tachanun_dialog">Here is a list of days with no tachanun:\n\nEvery Rosh Chodesh\nEvery Shabbat\nEvery Yom Tov\nChol HaMoed\nIsru Chag (day after chag)\nThe entire month of Nissan\nPesach Sheni (14th of Iyar)\nLag Ba\'Omer\nRosh Chodesh Sivan until the 12th of Sivan (7 days after Shavuot and the 12th is included)\n9th of Av\n15th of Av\nErev Rosh Hashanah and Rosh Hashanah\nErev Yom Kippur and Yom Kippur\nFrom the 11th of Tishri (day after Yom Kippur) until the end of Tishri\nEvery day of Chanukah\n15th of Shevat\n14th and 15th of Adar I and Adar II\nPurim Meshulash for walled cities (safek included)\nTu Be\'Shvat\n\nIn all of these cases tachanun is not said as well as for mincha the day before them. The exclusion to this rule is Erev Rosh Hashana and Erev Yom Kippur which are already before their respective days.\n\nFor Yom Yerushalayim and Yom Ha\'atzmaut, since there is a debate, we simply wrote that some say tachanun. According to Rabbi Meir Gavriel Elbaz, the minhag of Rabbi Ovadiah ZT\"L (as they did in the Yechave Da\'at Yeshiva/Kollel) was to only skip tachanun on the day of Yom Yerushalayim. Not the day before it or on Yom Ha\'atzmaut. However, Rabbi Yonatan Nacson writes that you are allowed to skip tachanun on both days.\n\nNote that there are other times you should not say tachanun, but this list is only for calendar days with no tachanun. There are multiple other cases where you can skip tachanun. For example: if there are mourners making up majority of the minyan, if there is a simcha (joyous occasion like a Brit Milah, Bar Mitzva, or Siyum Masechet), if tzet hacochavim/nightfall already passed, and many more cases.</string>

(שולחן ערוך אורח חיים סימן תכו)\n\nIt is ideal to say this blessing with a minyan on Saturday night with a nice suit on. (מעם לועז בראשית א:יד)\n\nThe time period for this blessing starts from 3 days after the Molad (new moon), however, Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L (and sephardim in general) recommend to wait until 7 days after the molad to make the beracha. This time period ends on the 15th of every hebrew month according to Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef. (הליכות עולם חלק ה אות ט\"ז)</string>

The Yalkut Yosef (Tefila 1:48) writes that the times for visible sunrise on this website are recommended to be used over any other sunrise time for praying at Netz.\n\nThe reason why we need you to go to the website is because the website uses a massive amount of data to calculate the times. It is not something so easily available on a phone.\n\nYou can always download the times at a later point in time within the app by opening the Netz dialog (press on the zman to see it) and pressing on \'Setup Visible Sunrise\'.</string>

    <string name="omer_dialog">Every night during the Omer we say a blessing for doing a mitzvah and then say the count which leads us from Passover to Shavuot, from the barley harvest to the wheat harvest and, ultimately, to the first offering on Shavuot itself of wheat from the new harvest, in the form of 12 loaves. During the time the Omer was counted, barley from each week would be brought into the Temple and waved as an offering, really as a prayer that the harvest would come in successfully.\n\nEach day between the beginning of Passover and Shavuot gets counted, 49 days in all, 7 weeks of seven days. That makes the Omer period a miniature version of the Shmitah and Yovel (Jubilee) cycle of 7 cycles of seven years.\n\nThe Omer count is made starting the evening of each day – when the count happens at night the blessing is said and when the count happens during the daytime the blessing is not said. After the blessing the day is counted by absolute number and by its number within each week, i.e., “Today is the thirty-third day of the Omer, which is four weeks and five days” – that’s Lag Ba’omer (lamed plus gimel, ל + ג = 33).\n\nThe biggest challenge of counting the Omer is that there are some poskim (Baha\"g) that hold that it is one long mitzvah lasting 49 days, while others (Rambam) hold that each day is a separate mitzvah. Even though the Shulchan Aruch holds that each day is a separate mitzvah, the practice is if you go one whole night and day without counting you no longer say the blessing because of Safek Berachot LeHakel.</string>
