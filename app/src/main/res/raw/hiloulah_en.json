He left the luxuries of the palace and escaped from Portugal. He arrived in Italy and soon earned the reputation as a brilliant Torah scholar. He even published 22 essays on the topic of redemption according to the secrets of Kabbalah in his work, Sefer Hamefoar. He met with the Pope and asked him to stop the campaign against the Marranos.

Ezra was the greatest Torah scholar of his generation, and he played an integral role in maintaining the continuity of the Jewish people and the oral tradition in the critical time of transition between the prophets and the Talmudic scholars. After studying diligently under Baruch ben Neriah, the great teacher and prophet in Babylonia, Ezra returned to the land of Israel after the Babylonian exile (during which the Purim story occurred) and spearheaded the effort to construct the second Temple in Jerusalem. He was so enthusiastic and passionate about spreading the words of the Torah, that the rabbis said that Ezra was worthy for the Torah to have been given through him, had Moses not preceded him. Ezra and his beit din (court) instituted ten enactments, including the practice of reading the Torah on Monday and Thursday mornings and Shabbat afternoon. His extensive efforts to bring the Jewish people back to Torah continued as he founded several schools of Torah study. Ezra's death ended a 1000 years period of prophecy, which started, according to some opinions, with Matan Torah, the giving of the Torah to Moshe Rabbeinu, the first and greatest prophet at Mount Sinai in 2448, 1344 BCE. Ezra not only wrote the canonical work which bears his name, but also compiled the Book of Chronicles (Divrei HaYamim) until he reached the genealogy of himself, at which point it was completed by Nechemia. Ezra served as a member of the Men of the Great Assembly (Anshei K'neset Hagedolah), and left a lasting legacy of rejuvenating the Jewish people to return to faith in God and keeping the flame of Torah alive, paving the way for the ultimate redemption.","src":"breslev.co.il"},{"name":"Nechemia ben Chachliah","desc":"Died: Eretz Yisrael, in 3442, 350 BCE. or 3448, 344 BCE.

As much as the books tell of the rebirth of the Jewish state, they also discuss the many hurdles that had to be overcome in that process. Of the many tens of thousands of Jews in Babylonia and neighboring countries, very few actually listened to Ezra's call to return to the Land of Israel, and the new community was sorrowfully small. Samaritans (Kutim) constantly attacked the Jews with arrows and swords, hoping to force them to give up the building. Eventually, the Samaritans slandered the Jews before the King, and asked him to force the Jews to stop building their Temple. It would be years before the work on the city walls and the Temple would continue. Nechemiah spent 12 years in the Land of Israel fixing the walls of Jerusalem and returning the people of Israel, each one to his city and to his inheritance. When the Temple was finally completed, it was only a subdued celebration. The songs of joy were drowned out by the cries of sadness from those who still remembered the grandeur of the first Temple.

R' Shneur Zalman, who became one of the pillars of the chassidic movement, displayed early signs of genius; as a 15-year old youngster he had already gained fame as a Torah scholar of high caliber. At 30 years he became a disciple of the Maggid of Mezritch, the most prominent of the Baal Shem Tov's disciples. In Mezritch he was initiated into the world of Chassidism and in particular the writings of the Ari. For the following 12 years he studied under the Maggid, becoming a member of his inner circle and one of his favorite disciples. After the Maggid's death, Rabbi Shneur became the leader of the chasidim in Lituania, the center of the mitnagdim (opponents of Chasidism). Undaunted by their strident antagonism, he succeeded in creating a powerful network of chassidic centers. In the year 1798, Rabbi Shneur Zalman was arrested and taken to the capital, St Petersburg, where he was thrown into prison to face trial for high treason and subversive political activities. On Kislev 19 in the year 5559 (1798), he was freed on the express orders of the Czar. This date has since been a festival amongst Chassidut Lubavitch. Rabbi Shneur Zalman formulates his thoughts in Likutei Amarim, better known as Tanya, which is its opening word. He expounds on such profound kabbalistic themes as the Oneness of God, tzimtzum, the sefirot, and many other mystical concepts. He also wrote Likutei Torah, reflections on the weekly Torah portions and the book Shir HaShirim. In the realm of Halachah he wrote the Shulchan Aruch HaRav, a comprehensive code of Jewish law.

She and her husband were childless, and when her husband passed away Miriam followed her lifelong dream to live in Israel, walking by foot to the Holy Land.\n\nMiriam lived in Jerusalem where she worked as a washerwoman, cleaning the laundry and homes of many families in Meah Shearim. Among the families she cleaned for was the family of the Reb Shloimke of Zvil, the Zviller Rebbe, who was widely known as a miracle worker.\n\nMiriam was a very simple woman whose hands were swollen from doing laundry all day and who couldn’t read or write. She was extremely G-d-fearing, earning herself the nickname “Miriam HaNeviya” or Miriam the Prophetess.\n\nThe current Zviller Rebbe remembers Miriam the Washerwoman from his youth. He recalls:\n\n“I did not know that they would ever make Miriam the Washerwoman into a historic figure, she was a very, very simple woman.\n\n“She could not read or write. When she had to say the blessing over bread, instead of reciting the actual blessing, she would say “Thank You” and kiss the bread and eat it. Even after eating the bread, she would say, “Thank You” and that’s it.\n\n“They said that on the High Holy Days, from the beginning of the month of Elul, she fasted for forty days in a row and would eat only at night, usually receiving meals from the people she worked for. Even before Purim, she fasted for three days. She would travel to Meron to pray. Her clients recognized that she was a special woman and they asked her to pray for them, and she agreed and prayed at the Western Wall on their behalf.\n\n“My mother told me that in the morning when Miriam awoke, she lifted up her hands and said, “Shalom Shechina [Divine Presence], Shalom Avraham Avinu [Abraham], Shalom Moshe Rabbeinu [Moses],” and more Shaloms to many Tzadikim [righteous people]. Then she sat down to eat, said “Thank You,” kissed the bread, and ate.”\n\nWhen Miriam was an old woman, the story goes, she came to the Zviller Rebbe crying, “Who will remember me after I die?

He was a product of the flourishing Jewish presence in Provence in the twelfth century CE, born in the south of France about 1125 and dying at Posquières (meaning \"place of wells”) on November 27, 1198. In that era Christians and Jews created separate communities within the well-defended village of Posquières. RABaD (abbreviation for Rabbi Avraham ben David) acquired most of his Talmudic learning under the guidance of Moses ben Joseph and Meshullam ben Jacob of Lunel, and remained in Lunel after completing his studies, and subsequently became one of the rabbinical authorities of that city. Next he went to Montpellier, where he remained only a short time, and then moved to Nîmes, where he lived for a considerable period. Under the direction of RABaD the rabbinical school of Nîmes was considered the chief seat of Talmudic learning in Provence. Besides being an active teacher, he wrote answers to hundreds of learned questions as well as a commentary on the whole Talmud and several compendia of rabbinical law. He is best known for his Hasagos on the Rambam and the Rif, but many of his other works are lost. The RABaD is often considered to be the source of the commonly used diagram of the Sephirot of the Tree of Life that was ultimately written down by his son Isaac the Blind. He considered Judaism a spiritual practice of deed, not of dogma, and followed an ascetic mode of life which gained for him the title of \"the pious”. In spite of his asceticism, the RABaD’s wealth and benevolence were famous. Not only did he erect and keep in repair a large school-building, but he cared for the material welfare of the poor students as well. It was his great wealth which brought him into peril of his life, however. In order to obtain some of it, Elzéar, the lord of Posquières, had him cast into prison, where he might have perished, had not his persecutor's superior intervened. When Elzéar was banished, Abraham ben David returned to Posquières (now named Vauvert) where he remained until his death.","src":"dailyzohar.com"},{"name":"Rabbi Shlomo Leib Brevda","desc":"Rabbi Brevda (1931 - 2013) is known world-wide, as a famous Magid Shiur who has delivered thousands of drashos in Jewish communities across the globe.","src":"dailyzohar.com"}],"1027":[{"name":"Rav Maimon ben Atar","desc":"(5718/1958).

His struggle came to a head in the summer of 1927, when the Rebbe was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in the notorious Spalerno prison in Leningrad. He was sentenced to death, but the timely intervention of leading foreign statesmen saved his life. Instead of being executed, he was banished to Kostroma, in the Urals, for three years. Giving way to further pressure by these statesmen, the authorities decided to release the Lubavitcher Rebbe. He was informed of this decision on his birthday, Tammuz 12. On March 19, 1940 the Lubavitcher Rebbe arrived in New York. Immediately upon his arrival, the Rebbe made it known that it was not for his own safety that he had made the trip to the United States, but because he had an important mission to fulfill during his sojourn there.

His father, Rabbi Yaakov Y. Kanievsky, was the widely revered Steipler Ga’on. When Chaim was 6, the Kanievsky family moved to Israel. On the sea voyage, Chaim sat day after day with his father, absorbed in Torah study. As they neared the shores of the Holy Land, they were about to complete study of Exodus, when suddenly his father kissed the book and closed it. “Let’s wait until we arrive,” he explained, “so we can celebrate in the Holy Land.”\r\n\r\nThis gave young Chaim not only an appreciation for the preciousness of Torah study, but also love for the land of Israel. Since then, he never departed the borders of Israel, and became a lifetime advocate for aliyah, encouraging people to move to Israel.\r\n\r\nRav Chaim’s childhood home was the center of the Torah world, with people from around the world gathering there to confer with some of the greatest rabbis of the 20th century. Besides his revered father, Rav Chaim’s uncle was Rabbi Avraham Y. Karelitz (the Chazon Ish), the premier Torah leader during the critical years of Israeli independence. The Chazon Ish, himself childless, showered Rav Chaim with constant tutelage and individual attention, grooming him in the art of Torah scholarship.\r\n\r\nRav Chaim, a child prodigy with a photographic memory, elucidated complex talmudic teachings at a young age. As a boy, he studied at Yeshiva Tiferes Tzion in Bnei Brak, amusing himself during recess breaks – not with a ball or board game – but by counting the number of times various sages are quoted in the Talmud. For his bar mitzvah, he completed the Babylonian Talmud (Shas), a feat that many do not manage to achieve in a lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn the 1948 Israeli War of Independence, when five Arab armies attacked, a state of emergency was declared and every Israeli was mobilized into the IDF, no exceptions. At the time, Rav Chaim was a 20-year-old student at the Lomza Yeshiva in Petach Tikva. On one occasion, a truck pulled up to the yeshiva and transferred all the students to the site of artillery fighting near Tel Aviv. Rav Chaim was ordered to climb a large hill and, due to the vast shortage of armaments, was given a stick and two stones to fend off potential attackers. Rav Chaim took along a volume of Talmud, climbed the hill and – in classic form – managed to study Torah the entire time until the skirmish was over.\r\n\r\nRav Chaim married Batsheva, the daughter of Judaism’s leading legal decisor, Rabbi Yosef S. Elyashiv (and granddaughter of Rabbi Aryeh Levine, beloved Tzaddik of Jerusalem). Rav Chaim’s illustrious lineage was unmatched, although that alone is insufficient to ensure success. Metaphorically, “nine zeros is not a billion” unless an actual number is added in front. So too, Rav Chaim was surrounded by Judaism’s leading Sages, but what he added at the beginning made it all count\r\n\r\nRav Chaim maintained a breathtaking schedule, waking at 2 a.m. for a rigorous 20-hour-a-day study of the entire biblical and rabbinic corpus including Tanach, Mishnah, Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, Midrashim, Zohar, and all the primary works of Jewish law: Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah, Tur, Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law), and Mishnah Berurah.\r\n\r\nRav Chaim toiled day and night, saying that the mental energy expended on Torah study is more physically taxing than digging ditches or laying bricks. Few people manage to study so many intricate works in a lifetime. Rav Chaim completed them all – every single year.\r\n\r\n\r\nRav Chaim published dozens of volumes that are modern classics, including Derech Emunah, Derech Chochma, Shoneh Halachos, and Ta’ama D’kra. With unparalleled breadth of knowledge, Rav Chaim was uniquely qualified in obscure topics of Jewish law, such as lunar cycles, agricultural laws in Israel, and a groundbreaking commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Rav Chaim authored tens of thousands of rabbinic responsa on nearly every conceivable aspect of Torah. Each week he would sequester himself in a room with stacks of hundreds of letters, and patiently responded to every single one. Due to the sheer volume and to maximize his time, Rav Chaim’s responses were record-breaking brief – typically a single line, and often limited to one word in microscopic letters, occasionally adding a reference to the Jewish codes.\r\n\r\nFittingly, Rav Chaim passed away on Shushan Purim, a day when Haman – descendant of the biblical Amalek – fought to annihilate the Jewish people. Amalek represents ideologies antithetical to Torah; the best weapon we have against that is the study and practice of Torah. For 94 years, Rav Chaim Kanievsky fulfilled that mandate to the utmost.

In his native place Kaindanover, with his whole family, was thrown into prison on account of a base denunciation, and was forced to languish in chains for years until he was pardoned, his son being retained in prison at Slutsk.

His father, Rabbi Yaakov Y. Kanievsky, was the widely revered Steipler Ga’on. When Chaim was 6, the Kanievsky family moved to Israel. On the sea voyage, Chaim sat day after day with his father, absorbed in Torah study. As they neared the shores of the Holy Land, they were about to complete study of Exodus, when suddenly his father kissed the book and closed it. “Let’s wait until we arrive,” he explained, “so we can celebrate in the Holy Land.”\r\n\r\nThis gave young Chaim not only an appreciation for the preciousness of Torah study, but also love for the land of Israel. Since then, he never departed the borders of Israel, and became a lifetime advocate for aliyah, encouraging people to move to Israel.\r\n\r\nRav Chaim’s childhood home was the center of the Torah world, with people from around the world gathering there to confer with some of the greatest rabbis of the 20th century. Besides his revered father, Rav Chaim’s uncle was Rabbi Avraham Y. Karelitz (the Chazon Ish), the premier Torah leader during the critical years of Israeli independence. The Chazon Ish, himself childless, showered Rav Chaim with constant tutelage and individual attention, grooming him in the art of Torah scholarship.\r\n\r\nRav Chaim, a child prodigy with a photographic memory, elucidated complex talmudic teachings at a young age. As a boy, he studied at Yeshiva Tiferes Tzion in Bnei Brak, amusing himself during recess breaks – not with a ball or board game – but by counting the number of times various sages are quoted in the Talmud. For his bar mitzvah, he completed the Babylonian Talmud (Shas), a feat that many do not manage to achieve in a lifetime.\r\n\r\nIn the 1948 Israeli War of Independence, when five Arab armies attacked, a state of emergency was declared and every Israeli was mobilized into the IDF, no exceptions. At the time, Rav Chaim was a 20-year-old student at the Lomza Yeshiva in Petach Tikva. On one occasion, a truck pulled up to the yeshiva and transferred all the students to the site of artillery fighting near Tel Aviv. Rav Chaim was ordered to climb a large hill and, due to the vast shortage of armaments, was given a stick and two stones to fend off potential attackers. Rav Chaim took along a volume of Talmud, climbed the hill and – in classic form – managed to study Torah the entire time until the skirmish was over.\r\n\r\nRav Chaim married Batsheva, the daughter of Judaism’s leading legal decisor, Rabbi Yosef S. Elyashiv (and granddaughter of Rabbi Aryeh Levine, beloved Tzaddik of Jerusalem). Rav Chaim’s illustrious lineage was unmatched, although that alone is insufficient to ensure success. Metaphorically, “nine zeros is not a billion” unless an actual number is added in front. So too, Rav Chaim was surrounded by Judaism’s leading Sages, but what he added at the beginning made it all count\r\n\r\nRav Chaim maintained a breathtaking schedule, waking at 2 a.m. for a rigorous 20-hour-a-day study of the entire biblical and rabbinic corpus including Tanach, Mishnah, Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds, Midrashim, Zohar, and all the primary works of Jewish law: Maimonides’ Mishneh Torah, Tur, Shulchan Aruch (Code of Jewish Law), and Mishnah Berurah.\r\n\r\nRav Chaim toiled day and night, saying that the mental energy expended on Torah study is more physically taxing than digging ditches or laying bricks. Few people manage to study so many intricate works in a lifetime. Rav Chaim completed them all – every single year.\r\n\r\n\r\nRav Chaim published dozens of volumes that are modern classics, including Derech Emunah, Derech Chochma, Shoneh Halachos, and Ta’ama D’kra. With unparalleled breadth of knowledge, Rav Chaim was uniquely qualified in obscure topics of Jewish law, such as lunar cycles, agricultural laws in Israel, and a groundbreaking commentary on the Jerusalem Talmud.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Rav Chaim authored tens of thousands of rabbinic responsa on nearly every conceivable aspect of Torah. Each week he would sequester himself in a room with stacks of hundreds of letters, and patiently responded to every single one. Due to the sheer volume and to maximize his time, Rav Chaim’s responses were record-breaking brief – typically a single line, and often limited to one word in microscopic letters, occasionally adding a reference to the Jewish codes.\r\n\r\nFittingly, Rav Chaim passed away on Shushan Purim, a day when Haman – descendant of the biblical Amalek – fought to annihilate the Jewish people. Amalek represents ideologies antithetical to Torah; the best weapon we have against that is the study and practice of Torah. For 94 years, Rav Chaim Kanievsky fulfilled that mandate to the utmost.

In his native place Kaindanover, with his whole family, was thrown into prison on account of a base denunciation, and was forced to languish in chains for years until he was pardoned, his son being retained in prison at Slutsk. Fearing another imprisonment, he decided to settle in Frankfort-on-the-Main. In Frankfort he recovered from the trials through which he had passed and found leisure to engage in literary pursuits. Besides publishing his father's works, which he in part accompanied with notes (as in the case of \"Birkas Shemuel\"), he wrote a book on morals entitled \"Kav ha-Yashar,\" being a combination of ethics and asceticism.

He received his ordination at the age of eighteen and in 1905 was appointed Rabbi of Swieciany, where he founded a large yeshiva. In 1913, he became Rabbi of Grajewo located on the border between Russia and Germany.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time that Rabbi Amiel was acknowledged as a great public preacher and his oratorical qualities were said to affect the most hardened hearts. He became one of the first Rabbis to publicly join the Mizrachi movement and Zionist organization, applying his speaking and writing abilities to the cause of Religious Zionism and national questions. In 1920 he was elected as one of the delegates to represent Mizrachi of Poland at the Mizrachi World Convention in Amsterdam. There he made such an impression upon the Jewish community that he was given the post of Rabbi of Antwerp, one of the largest and richest Jewish communities of the time. He set up a system of lower yeshivot for girls and boys by creating the Jewish Day School (as it came to be known in America), as well as religious institutes of higher learning.\r\n\r\nRealizing that he must actively fulfill his Zionist ideals, in 1936 Rabbi Amiel made aliyah in order to serve as Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv. This area had the largest concentration of Jewish population in the yishuv and presented a great deal of challenges for Rabbi Amiel. Particularly hard was the constant need to engender good relations between the religious and non-religious segments of the community. During his leadership he set up a yeshiva high school which taught religious subjects in the morning and secular in the afternoon. This yeshiva, named Yeshiva Ha’Yishuv Ha’Chadash, was used as the pattern for the B’nei Akiva yeshivot which were subsequently established. After his death the yeshiva was renamed Yeshivat Ha’Rav Amiel.\r\n\r\nHe also continued his work on behalf of Mizrachi in Eretz Yisrael, as well as running many Torah institutions in the country.

He ruled between differing views on the basis of a consensus between the three preeminent halachic authorities, the Rif, the Rambam, and the Rosh. The work was completed in 1542, but he continued to refine it for the next 12 years, and published a second edition. After he had completed the Beit Yosef, Rav Caro made a summary of his rulings in the form of an index without reference to sources and titled it Shulchan Aruch (\"Laid Table\"). It was completed in 1555 in Israel; it was first published in Venice in 1565. Eventually, the Rama's gloss (called HaMapa -- \"The Tablecloth\") was published together with the Shulchan Aruch in Cracow in 1578, and together they became the universally recognized Code of Jewish Law. The Rambam had published his Mishna Torah without references for his rulings. The Maggid Mishna, a commentary on Mishneh Torah written by Rabbi Vidal di Tolouse, had referenced six of the fourteen sections of the work, and Rav Caro set out to complete the references, while at the same time explaining the Rambam's view and defending it from the Raavad.

To achieve this goal, he retreated to his father-in-law's attic, where he worked on his sefer for 10 consecutive years. During this period, however, a Moslem tyrant gained control of Tunisia, and persecuted all those who did not accept his faith, especially the Jews of Kairuan.

(Rav Weinberg, known as the \"Bais Avraham,\" was a great-grandson and namesake of the first Slonimer Rebbe, known as the \"Yesod Ha'avodah.\" Rav Berezovsky's mother was a granddaughter of Rav Hillel, a brother of the \"Yesod Ha'avodah.\").\r\n\r\nThe future Rav Berezovsky studied in Yeshivas Toras Chessed under its rosh yeshiva, Rav Avraham Shmuel Hirshovitz (a grandson of Rav Eliezer Gordon of Telz), and its mashgiach, Rav Moshe Midner (a grandson of the \"Yesod Ha'avodah\" and a student of Rav Chaim \"Brisker\" Soloveitchik). He thus absorbed Talmudic studies in the Lithuanian style with traditional chassidic teachings. Shortly before his own passing in 1933, the Bais Avraham recommended to his cousin, Rav Avraham Weinberg of Teveryah that he take Rav Berezovsky as a son-in-law. (Rav Avraham's brother was the father of Rav Yaakov Weinberg, the late rosh yeshiva of Ner Israel, and Rav Noach Weinberg, founder of Aish Hatorah.) On Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan, 1941, Rav Berezovsky opened the Slonimer yeshiva in Yerushalayim. With the exception of the Yesod Ha'avodah, none of the Slonimer Rebbes or their predecessors, the rebbes of Lechovitch and Kobrin, committed their teachings to writing.\r\n\r\nAs part of his effort to rejuvenate Slonimer chassidus, Rav Brazovsky was responsible for collecting the oral traditions ascribed to these leaders in works such as Divrei Shmuel and Toras Avos. Rav Berezovsky also authored many volumes of his own teachings, including the seven-volume Nesivos Shalom.\r\n\r\nRav Berezovsky served as the Slonimer Rebbe from his father-in- law's death in 1981.","src":"breslev.co.il"},{"name":"Rav Don Yosef Nasi","desc":"(1524 – 1579).

Rabbi Kuli was not finished yet, after he published his master's work, even though he could have continued working on more scholarly works, he saw the deteriorated jewish life around him in Turkey and decided that he cannot leave the average jew alone who is crying out for access to the Torah. He therefore initiated the project of the Meam Loez series, a rich commentary on the entire Tanach designed and targeted for people who spoke the common man language Ladino (Spanish/Hebrew). He wrote the first few volumes before passing away unable to complete his work. The Meam Loez was so beautifully written that the readers were not able to put the books down after picking them up. Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan writes down his friend's reaction to the first several chapters of Meam Loez, \"It makes you feel like becoming a better Jew.\" It was eventually decided for Rabbi Yitzhak Magriso to be funded to complete the work on the Torah.

He was a weaver; while his hands and feet worked the loom, he sat with a book open in front of him, totally engrossed in the world of Torah. He was thus able to grow in Torah until the townspeople appointed him as a dayan (judge). This position, however, was totally not for profit; he did not make a penny off of it. In fact, the position's only consequence was the fact that it forced him to quit his weaving job, since Halacha dictates that a public leader cannot engage in labor in public. Instead, he took a position as a schoolteacher. The job lasted all day, since the children, in accordance with Halacha, studies from dawn to dusk. He lovingly and patiently guided them to climb the ladder of Torah rung by rung. At nightfall, when the children would go home, he was able to turn to the halachic queries of the townspeople. \n\nRabbi Idan also aquired vast knowledge of Kabbalah. When he once led the congregation in prayers, he skipped the Counting of the Omer. When people pressed him, his secret was revealed: His Counting of the Omer took some two hours, since he recited it with all the appropriate Kabbalistic kavanot (meditations). His prayers would often last for hours, using Kabbalistic kavanot. He was appointed to blow the Shofar at the main synagouge in Jerba because no one knew the kavanot of the blowing as well as he did.

Unfortunately, Rabbi Shlomo Pinto passed away in 1761, leaving behind him an orphan barely 12 years old. That same year, an earthquake completely destroyed Agadir, and numerous Jews fled and settled in Mogador (Essaouira). Rabbi Haim Pinto was to be found among the refugees.\n\nRabbi Haim Pinto studied Torah along with Rabbi David Ben Hazan at the yeshiva of Rabbi Yaakov Bibas, the Dayan of the city. Rabbi Haim Pinto’s reputation was so great that all Morocco resonated with accounts of his miracles and wonders, and this from his most early years.\n\nHis teacher, Rabbi Yaakov Bibas, died in 1769, and the community of the city turned to Rabbi Haim Pinto to accept the heavy responsibility of Dayan. Being but 20 years old, he finally accepted this responsibility in association with his friend, Rabbi David Ben Hazan. Rabbi Haim Pinto carried out his mandate as Head of the Rabbinic Court in an extremely firm manner, and when necessary he knew how to be very strict. Never did he allow someone to act incorrectly, exercising this function for more than 70 years. The greatest Chachamim of the generation esteemed him with fear and respect, and Jews and Muslims alike venerated him. His fame spread throughout Morocco, across the Middle East, and reached all the way to Europe. Eliyahu Hanavi revealed himself regularly to Rabbi Haim Pinto and studied with him, which explains why Rabbi Haim Pinto participated in all the Brit Milahs that took place in Mogador.\n\nAmong the many stories about Rabbi Haim Pinto z’’l, the following account has been gathered from the book on him entitled The Light of the Righteous.\n\nRabbi Haim Pinto awoke every night to recite prayers and to make “requests of G-d”. Afterwards, he would study Torah until dawn. One day his daughter Mazal entered into his room in the middle of the night and saw him studying with a man. In the morning, he scolded her and said, “Why did you come into my room without knocking?” She was not in a position to see Eliyahu Hanavi. “Now you deserve a punishment, meaning that on the day of your marriage you will become blind.” His daughter, who was a great saint, accepted the decree.\n\nA few years later, the grandson of Rabbi Khalifa Malka came from Agadir to Mogador and went directly to Rabbi Haim Pinto’s home. When he saw Mazal, she found grace in his eyes, and so he asked Rabbi Haim Pinto to give his daughter to him in marriage, but the Rabbi refused. He insisted, but Rabbi Haim Pinto absolutely refused. The grandson of Rabbi Khalifa Malka returned to Agadir saddened and hurt because the Rabbi had refused to give him his daughter as a wife.\n\nLater, Rabbi Haim Pinto had a dream in which he saw Rabbi Khalifa Malka, who told him, “I sent you my grandson happy, and you sent him back to me sad.” Rabbi Haim Pinto responded, “Your honor knows that my daughter Mazal saw Eliyahu Hanavi and a decree has been given: On the day of her marriage, she will become blind. This is why I refused her to your grandson.”\n\nRabbi Khalifa replied that his grandson would accept this decree as is. All of this occurred during the dream.\n\nThe next day, Rabbi Haim Pinto sent a special messenger to Agadir to bring the grandson of Rabbi Khalifa Malka to him. When Rabbi Haim Pinto saw him, he explained what would happen to his daughter on the day of her wedding, and he agreed. However, thanks to their merit and uprightness, this cruel decree was annulled and they had children and lived a great many years. They passed away in the same week.\n\nWhen Rabbi Haim Pinto would arise every night to study Torah, his Shamash (assistant) Rabbi Aaron Ben Haim, would also arise and prepare him a cup of coffee. Once, the Shamash awoke a little late and therefore hurried to prepare a cup of coffee for the Rabbi, when suddenly he heard two voices coming from his room. He then went and prepared an additional cup for the unexpected guest. In the morning, Rabbi Haim Pinto asked his Shamash, “Why did you prepare two cups of coffee during the night?” The Shamash responded, “I heard two voices and I thought to prepare a second cup for the guest.” The Rabbi told him, “Happy are you, my son, you who had the merit to hear the voice of Eliyahu Hanavi. However I decree that you repeat this secret to no one.” After the death of Rabbi Haim Pinto, the Shamash recounted this incident to the inhabitants of the city.\n\nRabbi Maklouf Ben Lisha came to the home of Rabbi Haim Pinto concerning matters of importance for the community of Mogador. Because of the fact that this was a serious matter, he went directly to Rabbi Haim Pinto in the middle of the night. He entered into his room and saw the Rabbi, whose face was “illuminated”, and someone else who resembled an angel. He wanted to come a little closer, but he was seized with such great fear and fright that he fled to his home. The next day the Rabbi told him, “Very happy are you, my son, who had the merit of seeing the face of Eliyahu Hanavi.” Rabbi Maklouf lived a long time, to the age of 110, and he described this incident in his prayer book.\n\nRabbi Haim Pinto of blessed memory had four sons: Rabbi Yehudah (known as Rabbi Hadane), Rabbi Yossef, Rabbi Yoshiyahu, and Rabbi Yaakov. All were great Tzaddikim, devoted to Torah and to Klal Israel.\n\nRabbi Haim Pinto of blessed memory left this world on Elul 26, 5605 (September 28, 1845) at the age of 96. On the day of his passing, he promised his disciples that those who would invoke his name on the day of his Hilloula would see their prayers answered. May his merit protect us.

However, the Sulitza Rebbe ztz”l of Far Rockaway, NY, who is a descendant of the Kozhnitzer Maggid, writes in his sefer that his family tradition emphatically rejects this story and regards this version of events as legendary fiction and simply not true.

Everyone that is, except Rav Shabsi, who remained neutral and would not involve himself in the dispute. He steeled himself and remained immersed in his davening, paying no heed to the strife.

Many Jewish communities had by that time been dominated by the Reform movement, with Orthodox members forming informal groups (minyanim) to represent their interests. Following the passing of the Austrittsgesetz, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch of Frankfurt, who had campaigned for the law to be passed, declared that Orthodox Jews in Frankfurt had the duty to officially secede from the Liberal Grossgemeinde. Bamberger visited Frankfurt, and declared that this was not mandatory. A heated exchange of open letters followed between the rabbis. The conflict ultimately led to only a relatively small number of Orthodox Jews seceding from the main community, and until the Second World War there were two Orthodox communities in Frankfurt: one under the auspices of the Grossgemeinde and the other one being Hirsch's community Adath Yeshurun.","src":"dailyzohar.com"},{"name":"Rabbi Marie Yahya Shoher al-Badihi","desc":"Rabbi Marie Yahya Shoher al-Badihi (October 18, 1803 - October 4, 1887), was a teacher of justice 'Moreh Tzedek', and Rosh Yeshiva \"Beit Salah\" in Sana'a, the capital of Yemen, and the leader of the Jews in Kochaban.

He was the holy Baal Shem’s beloved talmid muvhak, and is best known for his sefer, Toldos Yaakov Yosef. Chassidim affectionately refer to him as the Baal HaToldos or just the Toldos.\n\nRav Yaakov Yosef was appointed at a young age to serve as Rav of Sharigrod in Podolia, where he drew close to the Baal Shem after originally being one of his opponents and detractors. Chassidic tradition has it that the Baal Shem exerted himself to win him over and when he had succeeded, boasted: “Ribono Shel Olam – Master of the World! I do not request reward in the World to Come for my acts and deeds; I only request to be rewarded for giving You such a Yosseleh as this one!”\n\nHe is said to have passed away on the 21st (or 24th) of Tishrei, 5544 (1783), although the exact year of passing is unclear, as the writing on his grave marker and matzeva became worn and blurred over time. The stone is inscribed: “Ish Chai Rav Pa’alim Chassid Anav Ish Elokim Kadosh Yomar Lo” – which is roughly translated as  “a busy man of much action, a chassid, a humble, G-dly man, a holy person.” Rav Yaakov Yosef was the very first author of the chassidic movement, publishing the first chassidic sefer in history. His writings are amongst the movement’s most important as well. His sefarim are:\n\nToldos Yaakov Yosef, derushim on the Torah; Ben Poras Yosef, derushim and chiddushei Torah, including a copy of the famed letter of the Baal Shem Tov, describing his messianic vision of the redemption arriving when his teachings widely proliferate; Tzafnas Pa’aneach on Shemos; and Kesones Pasim on the Torah. He often cites the firsthand teachings he received from the Baal Shem Tov, over 280 times in Toldos Yaakov Yosef alone!\n\nThe groundbreaking publication of the Toldos Yaakov Yosef caused an uproar, especially as it was full of harsh criticism for the leaders and rabbanim of that generation and their derech of learning. Rav Yaakov Yosef blamed the shortcomings and failures of the generation on these rabbinical  leaders and attacked and criticized the entire establishment. Instead he suggested a new type of leader, the tzaddik and chassidic rebbe: “who would not ignore the ignorant masses, but be intimately involved in their lives and watch over their affairs, guiding, leading and loving them, and drawing them close to their Father in Heaven.” He continued, “The masses are the body and the tzaddik their heart, the soul of the generation. He must lower himself to lift them up, and Avodas Hashem could be done by anyone not just in spiritual matters but even with physical things.” These criticisms were one of the main catalysts behind the misnagdim’s opposition and a contributing factor to the cherem (ex-communication) they later pronounced over the chassidim. The sefer itself is alluded to in the Vilna cherem as well as in Rav Dovid of Makov’s kuntresim, Zamir Aritzim and Shever Poshim, polemics against the chassidim and chassidus, in which he calls it “a mesis u’mediach against Klal Yisrael.”\n\nThe sefer was publicly burned in Brode and in other bastions of the misnagdim. Tradition has it that Rav Yechezkel Landua of Prague, the Noda B’Yehudah, sat with his feet resting on the sefer. Rav Yaakov Shimshon of Shepetovka then travelled to Prague where he purportedly presented a scholarly argument that reconciled the work and its author, Rav Yaakov Yosef, to the Noda B’Yehudah, who afterwards lifted up the sefer off the ground and kissed it. The story of this meeting and debate was recorded and published as Divrei Noam and Darkei Noam, in many editions.\n\nThe chassidim, on the other hand, rejoiced with the sefer, and its appearance was reason for a Yom Tov-like celebration. Rav Pinchos of Koretz is quoted saying that: “There is no other such sefer as this which is Torah from Heaven.” Rav Yisrael the Kozhnizter Maggid once refused to pass by a certain house in Brode, saying that tumah (impurity) pours forth from there! Upon investigation it was discovered that the Toldos had once been burned at that location. Tradition has it that the very Heavens were disturbed by the Rav Yaakov Yosef’s cries of anguish over his sefer’s fate at the hands of its opponents and detractors.","src":"nertzaddik.com"},{"name":"Rav Yechiel Tzvi Unger of Dombrava","desc":"Rav Yechiel Tzvi Unger of Dombrov, the son of Rav Mordechai Dovid of Dombrov, founder of the Dombrov dynasty, was born 5570 (1810).

Almost all of the information we have about him comes from the Sefer ha-Qabbalah by Abraham ibn Daud.[1]\n\nAlong with his parents, Moses ben Hanoch and his wife (name unknown), Hanoch was captured by the Moorish pirate ibn Rumahis and brought to Cordova. R. Hanoch eventually succeeded his father as rabbi and rosh yeshiva there, although for a time he faced opposition by Joseph ibn Abitur and by the latter's patron, Jacob ibn Jau, the lay leader of the Jewish community of the Caliphate of Cordoba. So highly respected was Hanoch by everyone that even his bitter adversary Ibn Abitur (who has been exiled because of the ban issued by R. Hanoch on the latter) couldn't help but express his admiration for him, \"I bring the heavens and earth as my witnesses that there is none equal to R. Hanoch, from Spain to the academies of Babylon.\"[2]\n\nHis best-known student was Samuel ibn Naghrela.\n\nIbn Daud reports that relations between Hanoch and Hai ben Sherira were strained since the increasing stature of the Spanish yeshivot led to a lessening of their communities' financial contributions to the Talmudic academies in Babylonia. Indeed, Hanoch seems to have corresponded only rarely with the Babylonian geonim. However, Hai demonstrated his respect for Hanoch by honoring his excommunion of Joseph ibn Abitur and refusing the latter an audience.\n\nR. Hanoch left no written works, although there are some extant responsa between him and Hai, as well as between him and the then-gaon in the Land of Israel, Samuel ben Hofni.\n\nHe died of injuries following a fall when the bimah in the Córdoba Synagogue collapsed on Simchat Torah. Ibn Daud dates this incident to 4775 (1014 CE) but also states that it was thirteen years before the death of Hai in 4798, so the correct reading should be 4785 (1024 CE).","src":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_ben_Moses"},{"name":"Rav Shmaryahu Yosef Nissim Karelitz","desc":"Rav Karelitz (1926 - 2020) was the Rosh Kollel of Kollel Chazon Ish and the Rav of the Ramat Aharon neighborhood of Bnei Brak, as well as an Av Beis Din in the city for more than 50 years. With his passing, the generation has lost a giant in Torah and yiras Shamayim, a marbitz Torah and halachah, and a Dayan, who merited to serve the Chazon Ish, zy”a, both as a nephew and talmid.\n\nRav Karelitz was known for his greatness in Torah, his modesty and his remarkable histapkus b’muat. He constantly fled from honor, but at the same time, firmly upheld principles of truth and peace in his beis din, and did not shy away from making clear decisions.\n\nRav Shmaryahu Yosef Nissim was born on 18 Av 5686/1926 in Kosava, Belarus, to Harav Nachum Meir Karelitz, zt”l, one of the eminent talmidim of Kelm and Slabodka. After his birth, Rav Karelitz was in great danger, and miraculously survived. Therefore, it was instructed that he be named Nissim — despite the name being uncommon in the Ashkenazi community. Hence at his bris, he was called Shmaryahu Yosef, for his grandfather, Rav Shmaryahu Yosef Karelitz, the Rav of Kosava and father of the Chazon Ish, and Nissim for the miracle that occurred. For the rest of his life, he was primarily known by the name that marked the miracle of his survival. As a child, young Nissim attended the cheder in Kosava. But when the authorities began forcing parents to send their children to Polish schools, 10-year-old Nissim’s father decided to move the family to Eretz Yisrael. They settled in Bnei Brak, where they were reunited with the Chazon Ish, who had come about two years earlier, in Tammuz 5693/1933.\n\nRav Nissim’s lifelong involvement with halachah, and conveying it to future generations, was cultivated by his eminent uncle, with whom he consulted on all areas of halachah. Rav Nissim related that he was once walking with the Chazon Ish a short time after the latter had been ill. They walked slowly the whole way, and as they arrived at their destination, the Chazon Ish pointed out that despite the fact that they had walked so slowly, ultimately, they had arrived. “Had we stood in one place, we would never have arrived,” said the Chazon Ish. Said Rav Nissim, “I thought he was giving me mussar, but sometime later, I better understood what he had said. It was after he had suffered a heart attack and the doctors warned him not to talk for six weeks. Throughout that time, when he was able to speak a few words, he motioned to me to take out his notebook, so that I could write down a few words for him. I wrote three words that he uttered, and he couldn’t say any more. The next day again, he asked me to write a few more words. This continued for a short time, and in the end, all these words came together to form a se’if kattan in the sefer Chazon Ish on Hilchos Shabbos. Although he knew that after a time he would be able to continue to write normally, nevertheless, he still practiced what he always taught: that one is not allowed to be idle from toiling in Torah.”\n\nAfter the passing of his father, his uncle, the Steipler Gaon, zt”l, appointed him to serve as head of Kollel Chazon Ish in his father’s place. Subsequently, he began to serve as Rav of the Ramat Aharon neighborhood.\n\nIn addition to his harbatzas Torah in yeshivos and kollelim, Rav Nissim was one of the renowned morei horaah. In 5728/1968, he established a beis din in Bnei Brak, in his home. The beis din has several panels of Dayanim and addresses matters in many areas of halachah, including monetary matters, divorces, conversions and kashrus — namely the Otzar Beis Din during Shemittah, which particularly was known for its wine and grape juice.\n\nTens of thousands of people gathered in the streets for his levayah.

He was learned in Kabbalah and knowledgeable in all forms of wisdom. He was wealthy, handsome and of distinguished yichus.  There was a miraculous ner tamid in his beis medrash that burned all week long without oil! (Seder HaDoros)\n\nRav Amnon was close to the king, and the royal ministers tried daily to get him to renounce his faith and become an apostate. He never paid them any heed until one day the king himself asked Rav Amnon to give up his faith. Feeling uncomfortable in front of the king and seeking a way to push off the issue, he asked for three days to think about it. Not because he would ever consider the request at all, nor did he need any time to think about it before refusing; he was just giving an excuse to extricate himself from the king’s scrutiny. Nevertheless, the matter gave Rav Amnon no rest or respite. He chastised himself: how could he have given the king the impression that he was willing to even consider renouncing his emunah in Hashem and the Torah?! Rav Amnon’s friends and family tried to console him to no avail. The three days passed and he refused to appear before the king. When the king called him to judgment for disobeying his promise and failing to arrive, Rav Amnon told the king that he would pass judgment on himself and decree the punishment for his misdeeds: “My lying tongue, that even implied I might consider leaving my faith, should be cut out,” he said, feeling it would be a kiddush Hashem and just retribution for his equivocation. “No,” the king demurred, “Your tongue spoke well. Rather I will cut off the feet that failed to bring you before me, and will torture your body.” As they cut off each of his limbs, piece by piece, they cajoled him to avoid further torture by reconsidering and renouncing his faith and accepting theirs. But despite his horrific suffering, Rav Amnon staunchly refused. Finally, after the brutal punishment was completed, the king had the grievously injured Rav Amnon placed in a wooden box together with all his dismembered limbs and thusly sent him home. Seder HaDoros states that this is why he was named Amnon (related to the word ‘emunah’):  because he believed with full faith and self-sacrifice in the living G-d – Kel Chai [Translator’s note: perhaps Amnon is a pseudonym given to him as a result of this incident, or alternatively it was his true given name and the statement is a drash that his name reflected his essence, his true faith in Hashem.]\n\nOn Rosh Hashanah, Rav Amnon requested that they bring him in his aron, along with his dismembered limbs, to the shul, where they placed him by the chazzan. In great and terrible pain, he accepted his suffering lovingly as penance and atonement for his misdeed. When the chazzan reached the Kedushah, Rav Amnon asked him to pause and “let me sanctify Hashem’s name in public.” He recited the famous liturgical poem Unesaneh Tokef and then his soul departed. Three days later he appeared in a dream to Rabbeinu Kalonymous ben Rabbeinu Meshulam and taught him the words to the liturgical poem, requesting that it be taught and disseminated among Klal Yisrael and established to be recited annually each Rosh Hashanah, as a plea that the Jewish people be remembered favorably before Hashem.\n\n(Based on handwritten accounts from old machzorim belonging to Rav Yitzchak of Vienna, author of Ohr Zarua, who testified that he found this story in the manuscripts of Rav Efraim ben Yaakov of Vienna.

He levels harsh criticism against the Zohar for its endorsement of heretical teachings, such as that of the \"lesser countenance\" (Aramaic: זעיר אנפין), as well as against the new kabbalists who claim that \"lesser countenance\" is our God and we are his people, such as described by Sefer HaBrit (Article 20, item # 15) and by Yosher Levav (page 4), and who allege wrongly that it was he who brought us out of the land of Egypt, and that his wife (who is Malkhut) was she who smote the Egyptians in Egypt and at the sea, while it was he who revealed himself unto Israel at Mount Sinai and gave to us his Divine Law. All these things, Rabbi Qafih alleged, should be expunged from our religion, since the import of the Torah is clear that only God, and God alone, had done all these things for Israel.\n\nIn 1927, Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ retrieved the world's oldest complete Mishnah commentary from the genizah of Old Sana'a, that of Rabbi Nathan ben Abraham, President of the Academy in the Land of Israel (11th-century CE).

Rabbi Luria was one of the great Ashkenazic poskim (halachic authorities) and teachers of his time. He served as rabbi in various communities in Poland and Lithuania. His major work of halacha, Yam Shel Shlomo, covers sixteen tractates of the Talmud. However, it is extant on only seven tractates. In it, Maharshal analyzes key sugyot (topics) and decides between various authorities as to what the practical halacha should be. He emphasizes the importance of the Talmud as the ultimate source. In his introduction Maharshal alludes to the fact that he was able to study when there was insufficient light as if he were being guided from Heaven. His Chochmot Shlomo, glosses on the text of the Talmud and comments, is printed in the standard editions of the Talmud. However, it should be noted that the original separately printed version of Chochmot Shelomo is far more extensive and contains much more material. The Maharshal was an extremely humble person. Even as the rabbi of such outstanding communities as Ostroh and Lublin, Maharshal did not hesitate to appoint a preacher whose duty it was to reproach him for any wrongdoing and preach to him on the ways of the righteous, and whenever this preacher would enter his home, the eminent Maharshal would immediately sit before him in a most humble manner and listen to his exhortation as would any common person.

He wished to proceed to the river Sambatyon in search of the ten lost tribes, but he was stopped in Akko (Acre) by the Crusaders. He then set out on a return voyage to Spain. On his way home, he spent some time in Capua, Italy, studying philosophy, particularly Rambam's Moreh Nevuchim. Dissatisfied with this branch of learning, he turned instead to Kabbalah. Returning to Spain in 1271, he settled in Barcelona and applied himself to ardent study of Sefer Yetzirah and its commentaries, especially that of Rabbi Elazar of Worms, whose kabbalistic doctrine he accepted in its entirety. R' Avraham claimed that he was able to rise to the heights of Divine inspiration through the combination of letters and Divine Names mentioned by R' Elazar. He had numerous disciples, most notable among them, Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla.   \n\nIn 1280, he journeyed to Rome with the announced intention of persuading Pope Nicholas III to convert to Judaism. The pope, then vacationing in Suriano, heard of his plans and issued orders to burn the fanatical Jew as soon as he arrived. Although a stake was erected for the purpose, R' Avraham continued on his way. Upon reaching Suriano, however, he learned that the pope had succumbed to a stroke the night before. R' Avraham returned to Rome, where he was thrown into prison but released four weeks later.\n\nHe then journeyed to Sicily and settled in Messina, where he surrounded himself with many students and preached of the imminent coming of Messiah. His habits and prophecies caused much confusion among the Messina community, and they turned to Rashba (Rabbi Shlomo ben Aderet) , the generation's foremost Torah authority, for guidance. Rashba condemned Abulafia and his followers in the sharpest terms, and warned the community not to become involved with a false Messianic movement.\n\nRashba's condemnation compelled Abulafia to seek a new base. He went to Greece, where he composed Vezot L'Yehudah and Sheva Netivot HaTorah defending himself against Rashba's attacks, claiming that the Rashba did not know him personally, but judged him from hearsay. Indeed, in a later generation, Rabbi Chaim Vital cites him extensively in his book Shaarei Kedushah.\n\nIn total, R' Avraham authored 26 books, plus 22 works containing descriptions of his visions. His last known work, Imrei Shefer, a commentary on Beresheet, was written in 1291, a year before he died.","src":"dailyzohar.com"},{"name":"Rabbi Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman","desc":"Rabbi Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman (1913 – December 12, 2017), was a Haredi rabbi and posek (halakhic authority) in Bnei Brak, Israel.","src":"dailyzohar.com"}],"0925":[{"name":"Rav Chaim Chizkiyahu Medini","desc":"Born: Yerushalayim, Eretz Yisrael, 1832, and passed away: Hebron, Eretz Yisrael, 1904.
