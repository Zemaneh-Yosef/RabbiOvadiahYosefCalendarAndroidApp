        permissions, you can choose to search for your address or a zipcode and the app will find your location based on your approximate area.
        (Using a zip code is not recommended if you want accurate zmanim. It is better to put in your address.)

    <string name="long_explanation">
        I have heard from Rabbi Darshan (creator of the Ohr HaChaim Luach in Israel) that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L held that the actual sunrise/sunset that should be used for calculating zmanim is when sunrise/sunset is seen at the highest point in the city. However, Rabbi David Yosef Shlita writes that many have told him that Rabbi Ovadiah ZT\"L held to use Mishor (Sea Level) sunrise/sunset. Therefore, you can use the buttons below to choose the appropriate settings that you want. (See Halacha Berura vol. 14, in Otzrot Yosef (Kuntrus Ki Ba Hashemesh), Siman 6, Perek 21 for an in depth discussion)
    </string>
    <string name="settings">Settings</string>

    <string name="helper_text">Welcome to the Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Calendar App, this app was made to help you find out the most accurate zmanim of the day according to Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L for your own city! There are a few things to know before using the app.

 \n\n1.) You should ideally choose your city and download the visible sunrise tables through the simple setup, the elevation data is automatically downloaded. This table contains the most accurate times for VISIBLE sunrise, and this is the algorithm that the Ohr HaChaim calendar uses in Israel. However, these tables only go on for 2 years into the future and will need to be updated bi-yearly. If you do not want to use these tables, you can choose not to download them through the advanced menu, and the app will instead use the regular algorithm for sunrise (without elevation included).

 \n\n2.) There are a few different minhagim to choose from in the settings part of the app. Make sure to choose the correct ones for your city/kehila. For example, the default candle lighting time is set to 20 minutes before sunset, and the default end time for shabbat is set to 40 minutes after sunset. Please change these settings to your own customs.

 \n\n3.) Lastly, the zmanim can be included with seconds, DO NOT RELY ON THESE SECONDS. The only zman that can be relied on to the second is the visible sunrise time based on chaitables.com. Otherwise, these zmanim are NOT accurate to the second! You should always round up or down a minute or two just in case.

 \n\nIn addition to all of this, there are features in place that will automatically tell you to update the elevation data or the visible sunrise tables. If you leave the city that you currently setup the app for, the app will prompt you to run the setup again. The reason for this feature is because elevation will change based on the city that you are located in and you will have to update it every time you change cities, however, this feature will only turn on if you use elevation.

Pressing the "Setup your city!" button will take you to a page that will ask you to choose your city/area. Once you choose your city, it will set the elevation data for your city and it will also download a table that lists the times for VISIBLE sunrise throughout the next 2 years from a website called ChaiTables.com. This table will automatically be updated each year if possible.\n\nThe \"Advanced Setup\" option allows you to choose whether you want to set the elevation data for your city, or download the visible sunrise tables, or to do neither one and use Mishor (Sea Level) sunrise.\n\nKnow that the elevation data changes for each and every city and you will need to set the elevation data of your city every time you change cities.</string>

    <string name="alot_dialog">In Tanach this time is called Alot HaShachar (בראשית לב:כה), whereas in the gemara it is called Amud HaShachar.\n\nThis is the time when the day begins according to halacha. Most mitzvot (commandments), Arvit for example, that take place at night are not allowed to be done after this time.\nAfter this time, mitzvot that must be done in the daytime are allowed to be done B\'dieved (after the fact) or B\'shaat hadachak (in a time of need). However, one should ideally wait until sunrise to do them L\'chatchila (optimally).\n\nThis time is calculated as 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to the GR\"A) before sunrise. Both sunrise and sunset have elevation included.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out how many minutes are between sunrise and 72 minutes as degrees (16.04) before sunrise on a equal day with sunrise and sunset set around 12 hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them zmaniyot according to the GR\"A and we subtract that time from sunrise to get the time for Alot Hashachar. This is according to the Halacha Berurah and this should only be done outside of Israel in more northern or southern areas.</string>
    <string name="misheyakir_dialog">Misheyakir (literally \"when you recognize\") is the time when a person can distinguish between blue and white. The gemara (ברכות ט) explains that when a person can distinguish between the blue (techelet) and white strings of their tzitzit, that is the earliest time a person can put on their talit and tefilin for shacharit.\n\nThis is also the earliest time one can say Shema L\'chatchila (optimally).\n\nThis time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes (according to the GR\"A) after Alot HaShachar (Dawn).\n\nNote: This time is only for people who need to go to work or leave early in the morning to travel, however, normally a person should put on his talit/tefilin 60 regular minutes (and in the winter 50 regular minutes) before sunrise.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out how many minutes are between sunrise and 72 minutes as degrees (16.04) before sunrise on a equal day with sunrise and sunset set around 12 hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them zmaniyot according to the GR\"A and we subtract 5/6 of that time from sunrise to get the time for Misheyakir. This is according to the Halacha Berurah and this should only be done outside of Israel in more northern or southern areas. The Halacha Berurah writes to do this because it is more according to the nature of the world, however, it does not seem like Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L or the Yalkut Yosef agrees with this opinion. Elevation is not included in Luach Amudei Horaah mode.</string>
    <string name="sunrise_dialog">This is the earliest time when all mitzvot (commandments) that are to be done during the daytime are allowed to be performed L\'chatchila (optimally). Halachic sunrise is defined as the moment when the top edge of the sun appears on the horizon while rising. This halachic sunrise is called mishor (sea level) sunrise and it is what many jews rely on when praying for Netz.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the Shulchan Aruch writes in Orach Chayim 89:1, \"The mitzvah of shacharit starts at Netz, like it says in the pasuk/verse, \'יראוך עם שמש\'\". Based on this, the poskim write that a person should wait until the sun is VISIBLE to say shacharit. In Israel, the Ohr HaChaim calendar uses a table of sunrise times from the luach/calendar \'לוח ביכורי יוסף\' (Luach Bechoray Yosef) each year. These times were made by Chaim Keller, creator of the ChaiTables website. Ideally, you should download these VISIBLE sunrise times from his website with the capability of this app by pressing the button below. However, if you did not download the times, you will see \'Mishor\' or \'Sea Level\' sunrise instead.</string>
    <string name="achilat_chametz_dialog">This is the latest time a person can eat chametz.\n\nThis is calculated as 4 zmaniyot/seasonal hours, according to the Magen Avraham, after Alot HaShachar (Dawn) with elevation included. Since Chametz is a mitzvah from the torah, we are stringent and we use the Magen Avraham\'s time to calculate the last time a person can eat chametz.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as above except using the skewed Alot/Tzait of the Amudei Horaah calendar, and no elevation is included.</string>
    <string name="biur_chametz_dialog">This is the latest time a person can own chametz before pesach begins. You should get rid of all chametz in your possession by this time.\n\nThis is calculated as 5 zmaniyot/seasonal hours, according to the MG\"A, after Alot HaShachar (Dawn) with elevation included.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as above except using the skewed Alot/Tzait of the Amudei Horaah calendar, and no elevation is included.</string>
    <string name="shmaMGAdialog">This is the latest time a person can fulfill his obligation to say Shma everyday according to the Magen Avraham.\n\nThe Magen Avraham/Terumat HeDeshen calculate this time as 3 zmaniyot/seasonal hours after Alot HaShachar (Dawn). They calculate a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between Alot HaShachar (Dawn) and Tzeit Hachocavim (Nightfall) of Rabbeinu Tam and divide it into 12 equal parts.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as above except using the skewed Alot/Tzait of the Amudei Horaah calendar, and no elevation is included.</string>
    <string name="shmaGRAdialog">This is the latest time a person can fulfill his obligation to say Shma everyday according to the GR\"A (HaGaon Rabbeinu Eliyahu)\n\nThe GR\"A calculates this time as 3 zmaniyot/seasonal hours after sunrise (elevation included). The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as above except no elevation is included.</string>
    <string name="brachotSHMAdialog">This is the latest time a person can say the Brachot Shma according to the GR\"A. However, a person can still say Pisukei D\'Zimra until Chatzot.\n\nThe GR\"A calculates this time as 4 zmaniyot/seasonal hours after sunrise (elevation included). The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as above except no elevation is included.</string>
    <string name="chatzot_dialog">This is the middle of the halachic day, when the sun is exactly in the middle of the sky relative to the length of the day. It should be noted, that the sun can only be directly above every person, such that they don\'t even have shadows, in the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Everywhere else, the sun will be at an angle even in the middle of the day.\n\nAfter this time, you can no longer say the Amidah prayer of Shacharit, and you should preferably say Musaf before this time.\n\nThis time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal hours after sunrise. The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as above except no elevation is included.</string>
    <string name="mincha_gedola_dialog">Mincha Gedolah, literally \"Greater Mincha\", is the earliest time a person can say Mincha. It is also the preferred time a person should say Mincha according to some poskim.\n\nIt is called Mincha Gedolah because there is a lot of time left until sunset.\n\nA person should ideally start saying Korbanot AFTER this time.\n\nThis time is calculated as 30 regular minutes after Chatzot (Mid-day). However, if the zmaniyot/seasonal minutes are longer, we use those minutes instead to be stringent. The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated the same way as above except no elevation is included.</string>
    <string name="mincha_ketana_dialog">Mincha Ketana, literally \"Lesser Mincha\", is the most preferred time a person can say Mincha according to some poskim.\n\nIt is called Mincha Ketana because there is less time left until sunset.\n\nThis time is calculated as 9 and a half zmaniyot/seasonal hours after sunrise. The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute.</string>
    <string name="plag_dialog">Plag HaMincha, literally \"Half of Mincha\", is the midpoint between Mincha Ketana and sunset. Since Mincha Ketana is 2 and a half hours before sunset, Plag is half of that at an hour and 15 minutes before sunset.\nYou can start saying arvit/maariv by this time according to Rabbi Yehudah in (ברכות כ\'ו ע\'א).\n\nA person should not accept shabbat before this time as well.\n\nThe Halacha Berurah says to calculate this time by subtracting an hour and 15 zmaniyot minutes from sunset, however, the Yalkut Yosef says to calculate it as 1 hour and 15 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes before tzeit (13.5 zmaniyot minutes). \n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, both ways to calculate this zman are shown. The only difference is that the tzeit of the Amudei Horaah is used instead of the regular 13.5 zmaniyot minutes.\n\nThe GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute.</string>
    <string name="candle_lighting_dialog">This is the ideal time for a person to light the candles before shabbat/chag starts.\n\nWhen there is candle lighting on a day that is Yom tov/Shabbat before another day that is Yom tov, the candles are lit after Tzeit/Nightfall. However, if the next day is Shabbat, the candles are lit at their usual time.\n\nThis time is calculated as %s regular minutes before sunset (elevation included).\n\nThe Ohr HaChaim calendar always shows the candle lighting time as 20 and 40 minutes before sunset.</string>
    <string name="sunset_dialog">This is the time of the day that the day starts to transition into the next day according to halacha.\n\nHalachic sunset is defined as the moment when the top edge of the sun disappears on the horizon while setting (elevation included). Whereas, the gentiles define sunset as the moment when the sun is halfway through the horizon.\n\nImmediately after the sun sets, Bein Hashmashot/twilight starts according to the Geonim, however, according to Rabbeinu Tam the sun continues to set for another 58.5 minutes and only after that Bein Hashmashot starts for another 13.5 minutes.\n\nIt should be noted that many poskim, like the Mishna Berura, say that a person should ideally say mincha BEFORE sunset and not before Tzeit/Nightfall.\n\nMost mitzvot that are to be done during the day should ideally be done before this time.</string>
    <string name="tzait_dialog">Tzeit/Nightfall is the time when the next halachic day starts after Bein Hashmashot/twilight finishes.\n\nThis is the latest time a person can say Mincha according Rav Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL. A person should start mincha at least 2 minutes before this time.\n\nThis time is shown in gray on shabbat and yom tov (as advised by my rabbeim) in order to not let people think that shabbat/yom tov ends at this time.\n\nThis time is calculated as 13 and a half zmaniyot/seasonal minutes after sunset (elevation included).\n\nThe GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out the the amount of minutes between sunset and 3.75 degrees below the horizon on a equal day, then we add that amount of zmaniyot minutes to sunset to get the time of Tzeit/Nightfall. We use 3.75 degrees below the horizon because that is the time when it is 13.5 minutes after sunset in Israel.</string>
    <string name="tzait_lchumra_dialog">This time is calculated as 20 minutes after sunset (elevation included).\n\nThis time is important for fast days and deciding when to do a brit milah. Otherwise, it should not be used for anything else like the latest time for mincha.\n\nThis time is shown in gray on shabbat and yom tov (as advised by my rabbeim) in order to not let people think that shabbat/yom tov ends at this time.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out the the amount of minutes between sunset and 5.3 degrees below the horizon on a equal day, then we add that amount of zmaniyot minutes to sunset to get the time of Tzeit/Nightfall. We use 5.3 degrees below the horizon because that is the time when it is 20 minutes after sunset in Israel.</string>
    <string name="taanit_ends_dialog">This is the time that the fast/taanit ends.\n\nThis time is calculated as 20 regular minutes after sunset (elevation included).\n\nIt is brought down in Halacha Berurah that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL was once traveling in New York and he said to his son, Rabbi David Yosef Shlita, that the fast ends 13.5 zmaniyot minutes after sunset. However, in his sefer Chazon Ovadiah, he writes that the fast ends 20 minutes after sunset.\n\nIn the Ohr HaChaim calendar, they write that the fast ends at Tzait Hacochavim. I asked Rabbi Benizri if this meant that the fast ends at 13.5 zmaniyot minutes after sunset and he said, \"Not necessarily, the calendar just says that the fast ends at Tzait Hacochavim, a person can end the fast at 20 minutes after sunset if he wants to be stringent.\" I then asked him if those 20 minutes are zmaniyot minutes or regular minutes and he said, \"Regular minutes.\"\n\nTo summarize: If a person wants to end the fast at 13.5 zmaniyot minutes after sunset, he has the right to do so. However, if a person wants to be stringent, he can end the fast at 20 minutes after sunset.</string>
    <string name="taanit_ends_lchumra_dialog">This is a more stringent time that the fast/taanit ends. This time is according to the opinion of Chacham Ben Zion Abba Shaul.\n\nThis time is calculated as 30 regular minutes after sunset (elevation included).</string>
    <string name="tzait_shabbat_dialog">This is the time that Shabbat/Chag ends.\n\nNote that there are many customs on when shabbat ends, by default, it is set to 40 regular minutes after sunset (elevation included) outside of Israel and 30 regular minutes after sunset inside Israel. I used 40 minutes because Rabbi Meir Gavriel Elbaz Shlita has told me that anywhere outside of Israel, if you wait 40 regular minutes after sunset, that is enough time to end shabbat.You can change this time in the settings to accommodate your communities minhag.\n\nThis time is calculated as %s regular minutes after sunset (elevation included).\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by using a degree of 7.165. We use this degree because Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L ruled that regarding Motzeh Shabbat the listed time should be set as 30 fixed minutes after sunset. This degree is interpreted as 30 minutes after sunset all year round in Israel.</string>
    <string name="rt_dialog">This time is Tzeit/Nightfall according to Rabbeinu Tam.\n\nTzeit/Nightfall is the time when the next halachic day starts after Bein Hashmashot/twilight finishes.\n\nThis time is calculated as 72 zmaniyot/seasonal minutes after sunset (elevation included). According to Rabbeinu Tam, these 72 minutes are made up of 2 parts. The first part is 58 and a half minutes until the second sunset (see Pesachim 94a and Tosafot there). After the second sunset, there are an additional 13.5 minutes until Tzeit/Nightfall.\n\nThe GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts. Then we divide one of those 12 parts into 60 to get a zmaniyot/seasonal minute in order to calculate 72 minutes. Another way of calculating this time is by calculating how many minutes are between sunrise and sunset. Take that number and divide it by 10, and then add the result to sunset. The app uses the first method.\n\nIn Luach Amudei Horaah mode, this time is calculated by finding out how many minutes are between sunset and 72 minutes as degrees (16.0) after sunset on a equal day with sunrise and sunset set around 12 hours apart. Then we take those minutes and make them zmaniyot according to the GR\"A and we add that time to sunset to get the time for Rabbeinu Tam. This is according to the Halacha Berurah and this should only be done outside of Israel in more northern or southern areas. The Halacha Berurah writes to do this because it is more according to the nature of the world, however, it does not seem like Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L or the Yalkut Yosef agrees with this opinion. Elevation is not included in Luach Amudei Horaah mode.\n\nIt should be noted that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT\"L was of the opinion to keep the zmaniyot zman of rabbeinu tam whether or not it fell out before or after 72 regular minutes after sunset. However, in Luach Amudei Horaah mode, we use the lesser of the two times.</string>
    <string name="chatzot_layla_dialog">This is the middle of the halachic night, when the sun is exactly in the middle of the sky beneath us.\n\nIt is best to have Melaveh Malka before this time.\n\nThis time is calculated as 6 zmaniyot/seasonal hours after sunset. The GR\"A calculates a zmaniyot/seasonal hour by taking the time between sunrise and sunset (elevation included) and divides it into 12 equal parts.\n\n</string>
    <string name="ulchaparat_pesha_dialog">When Rosh Chodesh happens during a leap year, we add the words, \"וּלְכַפָּרַת פֶּשַׁע\" during Musaf. We only add these words from Tishri until the second month of Adar. However, for the rest of the year and during non leap years we do not say it.</string>
    <string name="elevation_dialog">This number represents the amount of elevation that you are applying to your zmanim to see sunrise/sunset in your current city in meters. If the number is set to 0, then you are calculating the zmanim by mishor/sea level sunrise and sunset.\n\nThere is a debate as to what Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL held about using elevation for zmanim. (See Halacha Berura vol. 14, in Otzrot Yosef (Kuntrus Ki Ba Hashemesh), Siman 6, Perek 21 for an in depth discussion) The Ohr HaChaim calendar uses elevation for their zmanim, however, Rabbi David Yosef Z\"TL holds that the elevation is not used for zmanim.</string>
    <string name="tekufa_dialog">This is the time that the tekufa (season) changes.\n\nThere are 4 tekufas every year: Tishri (autumn), Tevet (winter), Nissan (spring), and Tammuz (summer). Each Tekufa happens 91.3125 (365.25 / 4) days after the previous Tekufa.\n\nThe Achronim write that a person should not drink water when the seasons change. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef Z\"TL writes (in Halichot Olam, Chelek 7, Page 183, Halacha 8) that a person should not drink water from a half hour before this time till a half hour after this time unless there is a slim piece of iron in the water.\n\nNOTE: This only applies to water, not to other drinks.\n\nBoth the Ohr HaChaim and the Amudei Horaah calendars use the above method to get the time for the tekufa. However, the Amudei Horaah calendar differs from the Ohr HaChaim calendar, by using the local midday time of Israel. Which causes a 21 minute difference. Therefore, the Amudei Horaah calendar time for the tekufa will always be 21 minutes before the Ohr HaChaim\'s time.\n\nIn practice, it is recommended to keep both times if possible as it is only adding an additional 21 minutes.</string>
