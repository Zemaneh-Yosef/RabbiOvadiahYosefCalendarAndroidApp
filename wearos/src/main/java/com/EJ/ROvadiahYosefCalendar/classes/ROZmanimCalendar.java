/**
 * This class extends the ComplexZmanimCalendar class to add a few methods that are specific to the opinion of the Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L.
 * The zmanim that are added are based on the zmanim published in the calendar "Luach Hamaor, Ohr HaChaim" which was created under the guidance of
 * Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L, Rabbi Shlomo Benizri Shlita, and Rabbi Asher Darshan Shlita.
 * <br><br>
 * It is important to note that Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L used the Ohr HaChaim calendar himself and it is the only calendar that he
 * used.
 * <br><br>
 * Thankfully, KosherJava's complex zmanim calculator has all the zmanim and tools that are needed to calculate the zmanim in the
 * "Luach Hamaor, Ohr HaChaim" except for the zmanim that are based on visible sunrise. Visible sunrise is the exact time that the sun is visible
 * above the horizon. This time needs to take into account the horizon around the city. The {@link #getHaNetz()} method gets the visible sunrise
 * from a file that is used by the {@link ChaiTables} class. The {ChaiTablesScraper} class downloads the sunrise times from the ChaiTables website
 * and creates a file that contains the sunrise times for the current location.
 * <br><br>
 * All the other zmanim that were not included in KosherJava's complex zmanim calculator are calculated in this class.
 * <br><br>
 * On the subject of zmanim outside of Israel, Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L never gave a definite psak on how to calculate zmanim outside of Israel, and
 * it is not so simple to say that the same way the Ohr HaChaim calendar calculates the zmanim should be used also outside of Israel. The Ohr HaChaim
 * calendar calculates the zmanim based on the Minchat Cohen that used Shaot Zmaniyot. This works well in Israel, however, even the Minchat Cohen
 * agrees that outside of Israel there should be a slight adjustment to the times for alot and tzait because of the curvature of the earth.
 * <br><br>
 * Therefore, Rabbi Lior Dahan Shlita, who is the author of the Amudei Horaah calendar (and sefarim under the same name on the mishna berurah) uses
 * degrees to adjust the times for alot and tzait. I have sat
 * down with him and he explained to me exactly how he calculated his zmanim, and I have implemented his calculations in this class as well.
 * <br><br>
 * I have also spoken with Rabbi Asher Darshan Shlita (programmer of the Ohr HaChaim Calendar) about this subject, and he said to ask Rabbi Shlomo
 * Benizri Shlita's opinion as we was the decision maker on the Ohr HaChaim calendar based on his talks with Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L.
 * <br><br>
 * I then talked with Rabbi Shlomo Benizri Shlita about this subject, and he is of the firm opinion that the same way the Ohr HaChaim calendar
 * calculates the zmanim in Israel, that same way can be used anywhere in the world. He also said that he heard about Rabbi Leeor Dahan Shlita's
 * calculations for alot and tzait, and he disagrees because Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L never liked to used degrees since it is not our minhag.
 * Rabbi Shlomo Benizri Shlita also said that he has spoken with Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L several times, while creating the calendar, about whether
 * or not to use degrees for zmanim, and Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L always told him not to use degrees. He firmly told me that he believes that the Ohr
 * HaChaim calendars calculation should be used anywhere in the world.
 * <br><br>
 * Of course, when I asked Rabbi Dahan about this, he said that he disagrees with Rabbi Shlomo Benizri Shlita's opinion, since the Minchat Cohen which
 * Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L bases his zmanim on says to use degrees in Northern/Southern areas of the world.
 * <br><br>
 * I want to also point out that Rabbi David Yosef Shlita writes in Halacha Berurah (Chelek 15, Siman 261, halacha 13) to adjust the times for alot
 * and tzait based on the curvature of the earth. However, Rabbi David Yosef Shlita is known to argue with Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L on many subjects.
 * <br><br>
 * Since the matter is not so simple, I have decided to give the user the option to choose which way to calculate the zmanim. The user can choose
 * to use the Ohr HaChaim method, which is the same way the Ohr HaChaim calendar calculates the zmanim for Israel without any degree adjustment, or
 * the user can choose to use the Amudei Horaah method with degree adjustments, which is identical to the way the Amudei Horaah calendar calculates
 * the zmanim adjusted to KosherJava's methods.
 * <br><br>
 * Note: Rabbi Dahan used an Excel spreadsheet to calculate the zmanim for the Amudei Horaah calendar. I could not just copy the calculations from
 * the spreadsheet, because the spreadsheet uses a different algorithm to calculate the zmanim. However, I have talked with Rabbi Dahan about his
 * methodology and once I understood it, I was able to implement it in this class. I have also tested the zmanim based on his calendars (with the
 * seconds of the zmanim added) that he publishes, and I have gone over the zmanim with him personally to make sure that they are correct.
 * <br><br>
 * I want to just end by saying that I am not a rabbi, and I am not a halachic authority. I am just a programmer who is trying to help the Sephardic
 * community. I have tried to do my best to make sure that the zmanim are calculated correctly. However, if you are still trying to figure out
 * whether or not to use the Ohr HaChaim method or the Amudei Horaah method, please read the following story brought down by Rabbi David Yosef
 * Shlita in his Sefer, "Halacha Berurah" (Chelek 14, Kuntrus Ki Ba Hashemesh (in the back of the sefer), End of Perek 17):
 * <br><br>
 * "Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L was once traveling to New York with his son, Rabbi Dovid Yosef Shlita, and it was a Tisha Be'av. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L
 * told his son, Rabbi David Yosef Shlita, that at Tzait Hacochavim according to the Geonim (13 and a half zmaniyot minutes after sunset)
 * is when the fast ends, and you don't need to be any more machmir (Stringent) than that."
 * <br><br>
 * Therefore, based on this story, I have decided to use the Ohr HaChaim method to calculate the zmanim by default, since Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L
 * was the posek for the Ohr HaChaim calendar, and he said that you don't need to be any more machmir than the Geonim's opinion on a fast day even
 * outside of Israel. It seems to me that Rabbi Shlomo Benizri Shlita's opinion that the Ohr HaChaim calendar should be used anywhere in the world is
 * more in line with Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef ZT"L's opinion.
 * <br><br>
 * Methods used to replicate the Ohr Hachaim calendar's zmanim:
 * {@link #getAlos72Zmanis()}
 * <br>
 * {@link #getMisheyakir66ZmaniyotMinutes()} not in KosherJava, but implemented by this class.
 * <br>
 * {@link #getHaNetz()} gets the sunrise times from chaitables, otherwise we should default to {@link #getSeaLevelSunrise()} since it is similar to visible sunrise.
 * <br>
 * {@link #getSofZmanShmaMGA72MinutesZmanis()}
 * <br>
 * {@link #getSofZmanShmaGRA()}
 * <br>
 * {@link #getSofZmanTfilaMGA72MinutesZmanis()} for sof zman achilat chametz.
 * <br>
 * {@link #getSofZmanTfilaGRA()}
 * <br>
 * {@link #getSofZmanBiurChametzMGA()} for sof zman biur chametz, not in kosherjava.
 * <br>
 * {@link #getChatzot()} reimplemented to use elevation,
 * even though it does not affect the time,
 * I did it this way just because the Ohr Hachaim calendar does the same.
 * <br>
 * {@link #getMinchaGedolaGreaterThan30()}
 * <br>
 * {@link #getMinchaKetana()}
 * <br>
 * {@link #getPlagHaminchaYalkutYosef()} not in kosherjava.
 * <br>
 * {@link #getCandleLighting()} reimplemented to use elevation.
 * Remember to change {@link #setAteretTorahSunsetOffset(double)} to 20 if you want to replicate
 * the exact times of the Ohr Hachaim calendar. Note that the calendar also shows 40 minutes before sunset.
 * <br>
 * {@link #getSunset()}
 * <br>
 * {@link #getTzeit()} Not in KosherJava as of now since it is a very early zman for Tzeit and
 * Eliyahu Hershfeld is concerned about how people will use the method.
 * <br>
 * {@link #getTzaisAteretTorah()} is used for the end time for Shabbat/Yom Tov. The method
 * {@link #setAteretTorahSunsetOffset(double)} is used to set the time to 30 minutes after sunset in
 * Israel and outside of Israel (as instructed by Rabbi Meir Gavriel Elbaz) the time is set to
 * 40 minutes (which it is set to by default)
 * <br>
 * {@link #getTzais72Zmanis()} is used for the zman of Rabbeinu Tam
 * <br>
 * {@link #getSolarMidnight()} is used for the zman of Chatzot Layla
 * <br> <br>
 * The Amudei Horaah calendar uses all the methods above, however, the Alot Hashachar and
 * Tzeit Hacochavim methods are changed to include a slight adjustment based on degrees, and two
 * additional zmanim are added in that calendar. The two additional zmanim are for Plag HaMincha
 * according to the Halacha Berurah (also known as the GRA's Plag HaMincha) and Tzeit HaCochavim
 * L'Chumra which is a zman that is only used for ending fasts and determining which day a baby is
 * born on for a brit milah. The Ohr Hachaim calendar did not include these two times because the
 * halacha berurah was not well known by the time the calendar was made and according to Rav Benizri
 * the zman for Tzeit HaCochavim L'Chumra is merely 20 minutes after sunset which is easy to calculate.
 * <br> <br>
 * See these methods for more information on the Amudei Horaah's zmanim:
 * <br>
 * {@link #getAlotAmudeiHoraah()},
 * {@link #getMisheyakir60AmudeiHoraah()},
 * {@link #getSofZmanShmaMGA72MinutesZmanisAmudeiHoraah()},
 * {@link #getSofZmanAchilatChametzAmudeiHoraah()},
 * {@link #getSofZmanBiurChametzMGAAmudeiHoraah()},
